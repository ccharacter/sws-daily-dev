"1","1","What God Is Like","Faith That Works","<p><em>Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.</em> John 14:9.</p>

<p>An inscription on an early-American grave reads: \"Here lies Lem S. Frame, who killed 89 Indians in his lifetime. He was hoping to have killed 100 by the end of the year, when he fell asleep in Jesus in his house at Hawk's Ferry.\" Do you think this gives a true picture of God or does it show that someone has misunderstood His character?</p>

<p>The proper blend of God's love and justice has often been debated. The cheap brand of Christianity pictures Him as being a God who never harms anyone, and eventually lets everyone into heaven. The other extreme views God as looking for every chance He can get to destroy His creatures.</p>

<p>This misunderstanding of God's character has caused some people to stay away from religion. If many had accepted what they have been mistakenly taught to believe about God, perhaps God Himself would have been unhappy.</p>

<p>Philip said, \"Show us the Father.\" Jesus replied, \"Have I been with you all this time, and yet you haven't known Me? If you've seen Me, you've seen the Father.\" Jesus came to a world that was in complete misapprehension of God, in order to demonstrate what the Father is really like--what He always has been like and always will be like.</p>

<p>You see a man coming to the edge of a large crowd down by a lake. He has leprosy. As he comes, the people fall back. But Jesus invites him into His presence and touches him. And He says, \"They consider you under the curse of God? I will make you clean.\" Who was this talking? This was God talking!</p>

<p>You see a woman being dragged through the dust into the presence of Jesus. Her accusers stand ready to heave huge rocks at her to crush her skull. Jesus says, \"I don't condemn you. Go, and sin no more.\" Who was that? It was God--His love and justice perfectly blended.</p>

<p>You see a man hanging on a cross. He turns his head and manages to speak a few words, \"Lord, remember me.\" And Jesus says, \"I will. You'll be with Me in heaven.\" Who is that? That's God. That's God--the same yesterday, today, and forever.</p>

"1","2","God's Love For Sinners","Faith That Works","<p><em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</em> John 3:16.</p>

<p>The apostle Paul tells us that God's character has been misunderstood and misinterpreted since the beginning of the world. People knew something about Him once, but they didn't glorify Him as God. As a result they \"became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things\" (Romans 1:21-23).</p>

<p>It is possible for us, in our minds, to change God into something other than He really is, even if we don't bow down to idols of wood and stone. If we don't have the proper understanding of His character, then we're worshiping a false God! We understand that the last rays of merciful light, the last message of mercy to be given to the world, is a revelation of His character of love. Unless we know what God is really like, we won't be able to reveal Him to the rest of the world! Jesus came to demonstrate to the world what the Father is really like.</p>

<p>One day Jesus and His disciples passed by a blind man (John 9:1). The disciples asked, \"Master, who sinned? this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?\"</p>

<p>Their question was based on the common concept of God and evil. The people of Christ's day believed that disease and death were God's arbitrary punishment for wrongdoing, either by the sufferer himself or by his parents. Because of this, the suffering person had the additional burden of being considered a great sinner.</p>

<p>Jesus corrected their error by explaining that sickness and pain are caused by Satan. But one of the devil's clever traps is to project his own attributes onto God, and as a result millions of people through the centuries have blamed God for suffering, sickness, and death.</p>

<p>John 3:16 and 17 tell us that God loved the world enough to send His own Son to redeem us. He \"sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\" That's the gospel! That's redemption!</p>

"1","3","The Justice of God","Faith That Works","<p><em>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</em> Genesis 18:25.</p>

<p>There had been popular uprisings against Pilate, governor of Judea, and to restore order to the province, he had allowed his soldiers to invade the Temple and kill Galilean pilgrims who were offering sacrifices to God.</p>

<p>The Jews told Jesus about this calamity, not from a sense of pity and sympathy, but with a deep-down sense of satisfaction that \"this hasn't happened to me--therefore I must be better and more favored than those people to whom it happened.\" Jesus knew that, and said, \"I suppose you think this happened because they were great sinners above the rest of you.\" He continued: \"Not so. Unless you repent, you are all going to perish.\"</p>

<p>Jesus does not ignore the justice of God. In fact, it is an important thing to recognize the justice and judgment of God.</p>

<p>We know that a time will come when mercy will no longer plead and justice will be dealt. The Bible describes times in the past when God \"spared not,\" because His justice could no longer permit conditions to continue as they were. One of the times when God \"spared not\" is recorded in Genesis 18. Abraham, \"the friend of God,\" was bargaining with Him about Sodom's fate. He must have had a deep relationship with a friendly God to bargain in this way.</p>

<p>He questioned, \"Are You going to destroy the righteous along with the wicked? Suppose there are 50 righteous people within the city. Will You spare it for the righteous that are within?\" He appealed to God's fairness.</p>

<p>God was patient with this man who was trying to tell his Creator the proper thing to do, for He answered, \"If I find in Sodom 50 righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\"</p>

<p>Then Abraham became nervous. What if there weren't 50? So he continued to bargain for a lower number--45, 30, 20, and finally 10. And the Lord replied, \"I will not destroy it for 10's sake.\" You know the rest of the story. God saw a point past which iniquity and rebellion could no longer be allowed to continue, because He is a God of justice. There weren't even 10 righteous people, and Sodom was destroyed. But the pitiful handful of righteous were spared.</p>

"1","4","When God Spared Not","Faith That Works","<p><em>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</em> Romans 8:32.</p>

<p>God could not spare the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah when rebellion reached a certain point. Another time that God \"spared not\" is found in Romans 11:21. Paul was writing to the Christians at Rome, imploring them to change their ways. He reminded them that even though they were wild branches that had been grafted into the olive tree, God had broken off the natural branches because there came a point where He could no longer spare the entire Jewish nation.</p>

<p>A third instance when God \"spared not\" because of His justice is described in 2 Peter 2:5: God \"spared not the old world, but saved [only] Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world.\"</p>

<p>The fourth time that God \"spared not\" involves the very universe--</p>

<p>2 Peter 2:4: \"God spared not the angels that sinned.\" Sin went on in the very presence of God--rebellion broke out in His courts, led by a mighty angel. Although God was extremely patient, He eventually had to call a halt to the rebellion. You know the results of that war in heaven. Those angels who were cast out are still present in our world today.</p>

<p>Well, the justice of God looks rather grim, doesn't it? He didn't spare a city, a nation, a world, or even a universe because of sin! How can this same God ever find enough mercy to pardon one individual sinner?</p>

<p>There is hope for each of us because God \"spared not\" one more time. Romans 8:32 tells us that He \"spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.\"</p>

<p>If you will study the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross you will discover that this is the greatest time when God \"spared not.\" Here is demonstrated the realization that God gave Himself. None of this idea of God pleading for His Son to go, or Jesus pleading with His irate Father to spare these people! Away with such concepts!</p>

<p>Instead, you can see the Father and the Son involved together in this great sacrifice. Jesus was the greatest gift that God could have given us. He spared not His own Son so that His justice could remain true and His love could equal it.</p>

"1","5","The Call of Mercy","Faith That Works","<p><em>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</em> Luke 23:34.</p>

<p>One day, centuries ago, Jesus was in close conversation with the Father. The angels looked on. The air was heavy with suspense. Everyone was wondering how God's original plan had gone wrong after sin entered, and they were wondering what God would do to complete the plan.</p>

<p>After a long time, Jesus came from that close communion with His Father, and it was revealed that He had offered Himself to die in man's place. God gave all heaven, His own Son. He couldn't have given anything more.</p>

<p>Here you see God and Jesus together, one in purpose. They're together in this great plan of redemption. God's character is best revealed by Jesus and how Jesus related to sinners when He was on this earth.</p>

<p>He gave the Jews mercy time and time again. They had turned God down earlier, killing the prophets and stoning those who had been sent to help them. Finally, God sent His Son Jesus in person, as the greatest manifestation of Himself. \"Give them another opportunity.\" What a demonstration of His mercy!</p>

<p>If we had been on the cross, with evil men mocking us, we would have said, \"Bring on the twelve legions of angels. Bring them on. We'll deal with these people.\" But instead, Jesus uttered the pardoning words, \"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.\"</p>

<p>Even after the cross, God's patience wasn't over. After the nation was rejected, He continued to plead with individuals.</p>

<p>The Shekinah glory was removed from the Temple, but God sent the disciples first of all to Jerusalem, to the place where Jesus had issued the words of doom, \"Your house is left unto you desolate.\" During all the missionary journeys of the apostles, the Jewish people were included year after year.</p>

<p>As Stephen was stoned to death by an angry mob, the Holy Spirit came upon him, and he prayed, \"Forgive them. Don't give up on them yet.\"</p>

<p>Don't let this story rest simply with the people in Christ's day. Apply it to your life, to your family, to those you've been praying for. His call of mercy and love continues today--to every person, to every heart.</p>

"1","6","Mercy and Justice for All","Faith That Works","<p><em>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</em> 2 Peter 3:9.</p>

<p>He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it [fertilize it, as we would say today]: and if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down\" (Luke 13: 6-9). Let it alone this year also. Don't cut it down yet.</p>

<p>And did He cut it down after one more year? What does the \"Let it alone this year\" really mean? It suggests today that the mercy and patience of God is almost limitless. \"Almost\" because we know that there comes a time when mercy no longer pleads and justice must be dealt. But Jesus in His life here on earth gave considerable evidence that God is exceedingly merciful.</p>

<p>The combination of the proper blend of mercy and judgment is one of the things that Christians have struggled with for a long time. We try to figure through all the whys and wherefores of all the possible differences between the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament. This at times brings question upon the Old Testament and its validity. However, there are equal evidences of judgment in the New Testament. It's rather hard to surpass the story of Ananias and Sapphira for judgment. There are points that we cannot understand fully in both the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p>But it is for sure that a father of love will not let his boy hurt his girl without doing something to stop his boy. He doesn't love his girl or his boy if he doesn't do something in that kind of situation. We've heard a lot of angles in regard to God's justice and judgment, but there is one great beautiful truth that lasts to your day and to this moment. God's patience continues. Spare them this year also. Don't cut them down yet. Give them a little more time. Somehow the mercy and the patience of God blends with His justice and judgment, and we have redemption.</p>

"1","7","Two Kinds of Trees","Faith That Works","<p><em>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. </em>Psalms 1:3.</p>

<p>In the Bible, Israel and God's people have often been likened to trees. Isaiah 61:3: \"They might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.\" Beautiful trees, to bring forth fruit and foliage, shelter and hope.</p>

<p>The people of Christ's day made a great show of piety. They had a lot of leaves, much foliage. You remember the story of the fig tree, cursed because of all the foliage but no fruit. In Jesus' day the Jews made a great show of piety, more than did those of earlier ages. But they were \"more destitute of the sweet graces of the Spirit.\"--<em>Christ's Object Lessons</em>, p. 215.</p>

<p>Sometimes we confuse what the fruit is all about on these trees. The statistician says that the fruit is x number of souls saved, that the fruit of the Christian is how many people he can count on his list that he has converted, or how many stars he will have in his crown. That's not the fruit. The fruit that Jesus is really talking about here is the fruit of the Spirit.</p>

<p>The sweet graces of the Spirit--what are they? We are told in Galatians 5:22 and 23. \"Love, joy.\" You see a person who goes around gloomy--that means that he probably doesn't have a fruit of the Spirit. One of them is missing. \"Peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\" The people of Christ's day had many leaves, but few of the sweet graces.</p>

<p>As we approach the very end of time, we discover that God's patience goes on and on and on until the time of Revelation 11:18. There we find what it is that finally ends things in this world, that finally results in the unfruitful trees' being cut down. Evidently God's patience is going to continue until man has come to the place of destroying himself. It will go to that point. You know, if your eyes are open, that we have almost reached that place. Therefore the rest of it must be fulfilled very soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jesus \"is not come to destroy men's lives\" (Luke 9:56). And when the disciples said, \"Let's call down fire,\" Jesus said, \"You don't know your spirit. I came not to destroy, but to save.\"</p>

"1","8","Still More Time","Faith That Works","<p><em>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </em>Romans 8:38, 39.</p>

<p>A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?\" (Luke 13:6, 7).</p>

<p>The owner of the vineyard says, \"This tree is filling the place that a useful tree might occupy.\" When a tree has lots of foliage but no fruit, the first tendency could be, \"Let it alone--it's not doing any damage.\" But, according to this parable, it is doing damage, because it's robbing the world of the blessing of another tree that might bring forth fruit. It misrepresents God in the world, and is not merely useless but a hindrance.</p>

<p>In the climax to this story, when the drama seems particularly tense and you wonder whether the tree is going to be cut down or not, there is this argument from the dresser. He does not argue that the master's statement isn't true. It is true, and he admits it, but he says, \"Let it alone this year. Give it a little more time till I shall dig about it and dress it.\"</p>

<p>God and Jesus are together here, the Father and Son, in unity of purpose, and this is a dialogue between them. \"Shall we cut it down? Shall we?\" And they say, \"No, we will not cut it down. Instead, we'll let it alone this year. We'll try something else. We'll give it more advantage.\"</p>

<p>Listen, friend. Do you feel that you've about gone the limit and that all you deserve is to be cut down? Here you have the evidence of God's judgment concerning you in His day of mercy and grace. \"Let it alone. Give that young person, give that older person who has bartered away God's grace for years--give him another year. And then another one after that, and then another.\"</p>

<p>Man cuts off quicker than God does. What a God we serve! He doesn't treat us as human beings treat one another, but continues to offer His mercy and His love.</p>

"1","9","Mercy Still Pleads","Faith That Works","<p><em>And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: and if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. </em>Luke 13:8, 9.</p>

<p>Are you, O careless heart, a fruitless tree in the Lord's vineyard? Shall the words of doom erelong be spoken of you? How long have you received His gifts? . . . How often has the tender gospel message thrilled your heart! You have taken the name of Christ, you are outwardly a member of the church which is His body, and yet you are conscious of no living connection with the great heart of love.\"--<em>Christ's Object Lessons</em>, p. 216. The issue is not how much foliage. It is whether you are conscious of a living connection, a personal, vibrant, living connection with Jesus.</p>

<p>Wouldn't you like to be in the group who bear fruit and are never cut down? This is possible. We can respond to God's mercy by accepting and receiving His gift of Christ each day. There's no other way, because in order to realize the goodness and mercy of our patient God of justice, we need to study and contemplate Him continually. We may hear about His love from the pulpit, but this happens only once a week, or perhaps even less often. In order to repent daily, we need to contemplate and understand the goodness of God for our lives each day.</p>

<p>Listen, friend, even if you've run away from God because you've misunderstood His character: if you're now tired of running, but afraid He won't accept you back, hear His friendly words of invitation, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\" (Matthew 11:28). Find out what it means to fall low before the cross and to communicate with your Saviour, Lord, and Friend. \"In His great mercy God has not cut you down. He does not look coldly upon you. He does not turn away with indifference, or leave you to destruction. Looking upon you He cries, as He cried so many centuries ago concerning Israel, 'How shall I give thee up?'\"--<em>Ibid</em>., pp. 217, 218.</p>

<p>As we recognize His acceptance of us just as we are, and as we daily behold His love and mercy, fruit springs forth spontaneously. The secret lies in the living connection with the great heart of love.</p>

"1","10","The Friend of God","Faith That Works","<p><em>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</em> Hebrews 11:8.</p> <p>Many people question the God of the Old Testament versus the God of the New Testament. One person says, \"The God of the Old Testament was a God of judgment, a God who put to death men, women, and children.\" This is what man has done to God in the Old Testament. Let's look again at one Old Testament example of what God is like.</p> <p>You see a man who has left his country, his kindred, and his father's house. He has gone out, not knowing where he was going, believing God's promise to make of him a great nation. He is called the friend of God.</p> <p>Even after he reaches the Promised Land, the story has just begun. A famine comes, and Abraham is forced temporarily to seek refuge in the land of Egypt. There his faith fails. He fears that God isn't big enough to protect Sarah, his wife, who is fair to look upon. So he decides to help God out. He tells a half-truth, which is really a falsehood, that Sarah is his sister. When the king of Egypt hears of her great beauty, he has her brought to his palace, intending to have her for his wife.</p> <p>How did God handle this? Did He rain fire down from heaven to destroy Abraham? Did He withdraw His protection from him, from Sarah? Did He say to Abraham, \"Some friend you turned out to be--forget you\"?</p> <p>\"And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai Abram's wife\" (Genesis 12:17). \"Pharaoh saw in this stranger a man whom the God of heaven honored, and he feared to have in his kingdom one who was so evidently under divine favor.\"--<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, p. 131.</p> <p>A man who lied is under divine favor? How can that be? Abraham had sinned, he had failed, but he was still God's child, still His friend. This did not mean that God approved of Abraham's deception. But it must mean that God approved of Abraham.</p> <p>Apparently Abraham's friendship with God was based on something other than the occasional good deed or misdeed. What a picture of the God of the Old Testament--His mercy, His justice, and His love.</p>","10"
"1","11","Can't Run From God's Love","Faith That Works","<p><em>Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. </em>Psalms 103:13.</p> <p>One day you see a large crowd gathered on a mountaintop. They have been there since early morning, called together by a man the king has hunted futilely for more than three years. It's rumored that he is responsible for the three-year drought in the land, and the people wait, whisper, and wonder near the two altars that have been erected at Elijah's direction.</p> <p>With a blaze of fire from heaven, Elijah's sacrifice, the water, and even the altar are consumed, and all present are brought to acknowledge the God of heaven.</p> <p>That very night, aroused from sleep by a palace messenger, Elijah flees for his life before an angry woman. He fears that even the God who answers by fire is not big enough to protect him from the wicked Jezebel.</p> <p>He flees in terror through the darkness of the night, with the greater darkness of his own fears and discouragement accompanying him. Finally he comes to the end of his own resources, sits down under a juniper tree, and prays that he might die.</p> <p>\"Did God forsake Elijah in his hour of trial? Oh, no! He loved His servant no less when Elijah felt himself forsaken of God and man than when, in answer to his prayer, fire flashed from heaven and illuminated the mountaintop.\"--<em>Prophets and Kings</em>, p. 166.</p> <p>Instead of answering Elijah's prayer to take his life, a God of infinite love and pity, who knew his frame and sympathized with his humanity, sent a heavenly messenger with food and water to sustain his life. A second time the angel came saying, \"Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.\"</p> <p>When our faith fails, when discouragement comes to our lives, do we flee in terror, expecting an angry God to consume us for our lack of trust? Are we any less inclined to misunderstand His love and compassion? Do we constantly expect a God of fire and lightning to execute judgment, and fail to recognize the gentle touch, the still small voice, of our best Friend, who says, \"I love you just as much when the journey becomes too great for you\"?</p> <p>That's God speaking.

"1","12","Today I Must Abide at Thy House","Faith That Works","<p><em>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</em> Luke 19:10.</p> <p>And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich\" (Luke 19:1, 2).</p> <p>Jericho was known for its publicans and its tax collectors. It was the place where a Jewish man could turn traitor to his own people, give up to the Romans, and thereby make a good living. It was a place where a man could become rich, because he was given a portion of his collections. And if his collections were greater, so was his portion, and if his dividing of the portion was fraudulent, so was his increase in riches. So it was with Zacchaeus, chief among the publicans.</p> <p>Zacchaeus had heard that Jesus was coming to town. Already Jesus had sent His Spirit before Him. And the heart of Zacchaeus had been touched. He was desperately concerned with the possibility of seeing this Man from Nazareth, and the Bible says he wanted to see who He was. Who He was. It doesn't say he wanted to see what He did, or what He said; he wanted to see who He was. He was interested in getting to the heart of the matter. It's one thing to know something about what Jesus said; it's another thing to know who He is.</p> <p>\"And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature\" (verse 3). Imagine seeing this man Zacchaeus, who ordinarily would walk with all of his five-foot dignity down the streets of Jericho with as much composure as possible, running for a tree with the street urchins. Obviously, in seeking Jesus he had forgotten himself.</p> <p>\"When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully\" (verses 5, 6).</p> <p>In inviting Himself to Zacchaeus' house, Jesus was simply accepting the invitation that had already gone out from the heart of this publican.

But he answered her not a word.\"</p> <p>Have you ever been ignored? How did you like it? It's surprising that she stayed around. \"And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.\" She's bothering us. Why don't you get rid of her? Jesus' first words, apparently going along with the disciples, were, \"I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\" \"Then came she and worshipped him.\" Worshiped Him? Do you worship the people who ignore you and say they didn't come to help you? And she said, \"Lord, help me. But he answered and said, It is not meet [right] to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs.\" But this was the opening she had been looking for. \"She said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\" If I am a dog, I am entitled to some dog food.</p> <p>Jesus must have had a twinkle in His eye during this whole conversation. She must have seen it. \"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour\" (Matthew 15:21-28).</p> <p>How do you define \"faith\" in this story? Taking God at His word? If she had taken God at His word, she would have been gone long before He got to the \"dogs\" part. Do you define faith in terms of believing? Believing what Jesus said? You can't. It doesn't fit. Faith, in her case, was disbelieving what Jesus said. Faith was not taking Him at His word.</p> <p>So you come to the definition of faith as Jesus used it. It is the real definition of faith. One word: trust. The book <em>Education</em>, page 253, says, \"Faith is trusting God.\"</p> <p>The premise is that Jesus is completely trustworthy. If you don't believe that, you don't know Him yet.

But that's what He said. \"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.\" The rich young ruler asked, \"Which?\" \"Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal,\" and so on. And the young man said, \"All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\" Here is the strong man, the behaviorist. He is a good liver. Wouldn't think of doing anything wrong. And then Jesus reveals what He was really after with this man. \"Jesus said unto him, If you wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, . . . and come and follow me.\"</p> <p>Jesus didn't always come right to the point with people who were searching for truth. In fact, He was pretty clever in His approach, not for the sake of cleverness, but because He had wisdom that came from His Father and His connection with His Father.</p> <p>\"What shall I do to enter into life?\" \"Keep the commandments.\" \"I have.\" \"Oh, yes? Let Me give you one more.\" He gave him one more, and the man hung his head and began kicking his toe in the dust. He was a strong, successful, external moral behaviorist, and he had nothing within. He was helpless.</p> <p>Now, that is the point to which each of us must come when we genuinely come to Christ. We have to admit that we're helpless to do anything in our own strength, except give up trying to do something apart from Christ, and come to Him, just as we are.</p>","14"
"1","15","Sorrow For the Broken Heart","Faith That Works","<p><em>Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</em> Romans 2:4.</p> <p>Jesus came to demonstrate to His disciples, and to all of us, the love and forgiveness of our heavenly Father. He wanted to show us that God does not condemn us--that's the work of the enemy. He wanted to show that God is constantly working in every possible way to get as many people to accept His love as He possibly can. His lovingkindness leads us to repentance, as it did in the experience of Peter.</p> <p>Peter stood by the fire and they pointed the finger at him. He said, \"Oh, no. No, I'm not. I'm not, either.\" And they said, \"Yes, you are.\" Finally, he began to curse and swear and to deny that he ever knew Jesus.</p> <p>Right in the middle of his cursing and swearing, he looked across the way and saw Jesus looking at him. In that look was no anger or resentment or hurt feelings. There was a look of pity, of sorrow. As Peter looked upon the face of Jesus, a flood of memories began to come back. He saw himself by the sea when Jesus called him to follow Him. Again he saw himself in the hassle over the Temple authorities and tax coins, and Jesus went to his aid and got him out of the jam. Once more he saw himself out in the sea. Jesus is reaching down and pulling him up out of the angry waters. And again, just a few hours earlier--he could still see it--walking in the Garden with Jesus, and He had said, \"Peter, Satan is determined to have you, but I've prayed for you. I've prayed for you.\"</p> <p>And all these memories came flooding in. Peter was transfixed on the spot. Suddenly, as he stood there, he saw another hand raised to slap Jesus, and he realized that that was the same as his hand, and that he had dealt the hardest blow to the heart of Jesus that night. Blindly he turned from the fire and rushed out of the courtyard gate, out of the city, across the brook, into the Garden.</p> <p>There he groped around in the darkness until he found the place where Jesus had been praying. He fell on his face and wished he could die. He was really sorry. He had broken the heart of his best Friend. Peter's was real repentance.</p>","15"
"1","16","Hope For the Hopeless Sinner","Faith That Works","<p><em>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</em> Matthew 8:2.</p> <p>There was a man who was a lonely figure in the country of Palestine in the days of Christ. He had been driven from the city, from home, from friends, from all loved ones. He had no more friends; he was a wretch of humanity, dirty, disheveled. His clothes were in rags, his skin was eaten away, and parts of his body were gone. He was a victim of one of the most loathed diseases of all the East. He had leprosy! He sat by the roadside publishing his mournful condition by crying, \"Unclean, unclean!\" But he heard of Jesus, of how He'd raised the dead, opened blind eyes, forgiven people's sins. Ah, sin was what plagued his heart. Could Jesus somehow do anything for him?</p> <p>This man thought and pondered and planned and hoped, until one day he began creeping along the road toward a lakeshore. He was looking for that large crowd around Jesus. As he came to the crowd, some of those on the outer fringe saw him. They fell back in horror and began to rebuke him, to get him to leave. This happens many times among human beings today. Remember this: it is human nature that a person who desperately needs attention, and seeks it, repulses other people. But never does he repulse Jesus Christ--never!</p> <p>As this man came to the edge of the crowd, he was rebuked, but he could not be stopped. The crowd fell back in fear, but as they did, a way was made for him to get to Jesus. This poor man came into the presence of Jesus. As he came, he fell on his face in front of Him, right there on the ground. He said, \"Lord, if You will You can make me clean.\"</p> <p>He had tried everything! He had tried doctors, he had tried will-power, he had tried \"trying.\" He tried friends who had finally deserted him. He had tried everything he knew of, until there was only one choice left for him. \"Lord, if You will You can make me clean.\" Immediately the words came from Jesus' lips, \"I will; be thou clean.\" And he was made whole from that very hour!</p> <p>A heart still incapable of goodness but capable of love is accepted. God accepts the person, not for what he is, but for what God sees he can become, through the indwelling of Jesus Christ.</p>","16"
"1","17","Hope For the Helpless Sinner","Faith That Works","<p><em>There is none that seeketh after God.</em> Romans 3:11.</p> <p>The tax-gatherers and other bad characters were all crowding in to listen to him [Jesus]; and the Pharisees and the doctors of the law began grumbling among themselves: 'This fellow,' they said, 'welcomes sinners and eats with them.'\" Now that was a great truth. This man, Jesus, welcomes sinners. They didn't know what they were saying, but they were saying something of great worth. And Jesus \"answered them with this parable: 'If one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the missing one until he has found it? How delighted he is then! He lifts it on to his shoulders, and home he goes to call his friends and neighbors together. \"Rejoice with me!\" he cries. \"I have found my lost sheep.\" In the same way, I tell you, there will be greater joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent'\" (Luke 15:2-8, NEB).</p> <p>Sheep. A sheep knows that it's lost when it's lost, but it does not know the way back. One sheep is the smallest number of sheep that can be lost, and it will wander helplessly and perish unless it is brought back. In the story of the sheep, Jesus makes it clear that salvation does not come from our seeking after God, but from God seeking after us. We may not always know the way back. We may not even know that we are lost. Yet God goes out looking.</p> <p>We are not after an evasive God. We are not trying to find, somewhere, a God who is trying to elude us. That is not the kind of God we serve. We serve, and we believe in, a God who followed Adam when he was running away. A God who followed Jacob when he was running away. A God who followed Jonah when he was deliberately running away. A God who followed Saul of Tarsus as he ran from those scenes in Jerusalem that had almost broken his heart. Instead of us seeking and trying to find God or to find Christ, as a rule, we are in the process of running away from Him. To begin with, and sometimes even after we have accepted Him at first, we do some running, too. And He keeps running after us. God is always the One who takes the initiative. And He is seeking each one of us today.</p>","17"

In fact, he said, \"There is none that seeketh after God\" (verse 11). If we will seek Him, we'll find Him when we have searched for Him with all our hearts, but none seeketh after God. Then where does the seeking begin? We are supposed to seek, but none seek.</p> <p>\"'If a woman has ten silver pieces and loses one of them, does she not light the lamp, sweep out the house, look in every corner till she has found it?

And the One goes out and looks for this lost coin. In the lost-coin symbol, it was lost in the house instead of out in the mountains somewhere, and perhaps we could go so far as to say it was lost within the church. Or lost in the family. And it's lost among the rubbish and the rubble of an ancient Middle East dwelling, but the search continues because it is still a piece of silver. It's still of value, and the value of one soul can never be overestimated in the eyes of Heaven.</p> <p>\"And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me . . .\" How? \"With all your heart.\" \"With all your heart.\"</p> <p>It is the sense of need that makes the difference.

And the father followed him all the time--with his binoculars, shall we say--and was out looking for him on the day of his return.</p> <p>And so through this parable, Jesus is demonstrating the goodness and kindness of the Father, and He is saying, \"For any type of person, we are out looking. We're out looking for you.\" The truth is that that is God's business and the great plan of salvation. The God who allowed you to be born, about which you had no choice, is not a God who is going to leave you wandering and lost, whether we know we are lost or whether we don't know it, whether we know the way back or whether we don't. He is going to stay with us until that moment of truth in our lives when by our own conscious intelligence and our reasoning we can accept Him or reject Him.</p> <p>Like the prodigal son, we are running away from self-surrender. We are running away from the moment of truth in which we face ourselves with the realization that we are incapable for life and for handling the things of eternity.</p> <p>One way we run away is by just plain busy-ness. We feel we have to keep busy, whether it is with books or studies, work or pleasure--just keep busy, occupied. It's possible for this to become a convenient route for running away.

"1","20","Gospel According to Mary","Faith That Works","<p><em>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</em> Matthew 11:28.</p> <p>In the village of Bethany lived two women, Mary and Martha, with their brother Lazarus, who evidently was the breadwinner for the family. Father and mother must have been gone. Both women were well known, but Mary was more outgoing than Martha. She felt at home with the crowd. Everybody liked Mary. And whenever there was a banquet or church potluck Mary was always there to make people feel at home.</p> <p>One day, one of the church leaders, named Simon, began to notice Mary in a special way. He decided deep down inside that he was going to get better acquainted with her. And he did. Mary suspected nothing, at first. She was friendly to everybody. With the help of the archenemy, Simon was able, little by little, to lead Mary into sin.</p> <p>She wasn't able to hide it forever, and gradually it became known around town that Mary was a \"loose\" woman. Things got so unbearable in Bethany that Mary packed her few belongings and left town. She traveled down Mount Moriah to a town called Magdala. She later became known as Mary of Magdala.</p> <p>There Mary began to make some \"easy\" money. It turned out not to be so easy in the end. She found some people who were willing to pay her price, and oddly enough, she even found a degree of acceptance among these--people who became her friends and came back again and again. But the load got heavier and heavier on her shoulders. She found the easy money turning to bitterness.</p> <p>One day a traveling preacher came to town. He stood in the streets of Magdala and began to tell people things they had never heard before. In those days, no one accepted publicans and harlots and thieves. But Jesus said, \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\" Rest? For Mary, who had been lying awake at night? She heard words such as, \"Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out\" (John 6:37).</p> <p>For the first time in her life, Mary saw a glimpse of the true character of God--of His love, which was revealed through Jesus--and she realized that God would accept her. She no longer had to run away from a God she feared.</p>","20"
"1","21","Loving Acceptance","Faith That Works","<p><em>Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</em> John 6:37.</p> <p>We've often heard the idea that conversion is an immediate, complete, absolute, final change of life--that we'll have no more problems from then on, no more weaknesses, no more failures. And when problems do arise, then we think we haven't really been converted. But remember this: conversion is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit on the human heart, producing a change of attitude toward God; instead of being against Him, now you're for Him. Conversion creates in the person a new capacity for knowing and loving God--it's the turning-around point, the beginning, but that's all it is. And we're told we need to be converted every day, not just once and for all.</p> <p>The first time Mary of Magdala heard Jesus speaking, she couldn't believe the words of comfort. Religious leaders accepted only the good, moral churchgoers--not sinners, harlots, and thieves! It was almost more than she could stand. With her broken heart, she pressed through the crowd after the outdoor service, and right there in the open, she poured out her heart to Jesus and told Him of her burden. Jesus accepted her. He prayed for her with strong prayers, seeking His Father's presence in her behalf. And Mary was converted right there on the spot. Her load of sin and guilt left her. Conversion, as usually happens, came when she was desperate enough to give up on herself entirely.</p> <p>We'd like to say that the story ends there. But the truth is that Mary failed, evidently shortly after Jesus left town. She stayed where she was, the same crowd was around, the same voices whispered to her in the marketplace. When Jesus was not in town, she found it difficult to hold on to the peace she had found from hearing His words and from being with Him. But she still had that change of attitude toward God, and her capacity for knowing Him was still down inside. And the next time Jesus came through town, she poured out her troubles to Him, and again He worked in her behalf. He accepted her again. The Bible records that Jesus cast out seven devils from her. But He always accepted her, as He always accepts anyone who comes to Him. It was in this attitude of loving acceptance that Mary's heart was broken anew.</p>","21"
"1","22","Sitting at Jesus' Feet","Faith That Works","<p><em>Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace.</em> Job 22:21.</p> <p>Jesus cast seven devils out of Mary of Magdala. Seven times He worked in her behalf, but finally, one day, she learned the secret of righteousness by faith. It was the experience that being with Him produces, and He must have helped her to find it out. What is the secret? It is in sitting at the feet of Jesus, even when Jesus isn't in town. Is that possible? Yes, it is. And when Mary learned that, she began to go to her own knees with strong prayers, seeking communion with the Father each day, growing in a relationship with Him. And things began to get better. Why? Because as Jesus comes in, sin is crowded out. There's no point in trying to stamp it out ourselves; it will never work that way. It happens only by Jesus coming in, for our weaknesses are then surmounted by His power. That's why Jesus accepts people just as they are. Only He can make the changes. If we look at our sins, we'll become more like them, but if we behold Christ, we'll become like Him. Mary learned that rather than dwelling on her sins and her failures, she should concentrate on God's love.</p> <p>Things got so much better for Mary, there in Magdala, where she was living, that she began to get up new hopes about going home to Bethany again. Maybe they would accept her now. It would be nice to see Martha and Lazarus again. She packed up her things, and headed back up to the top of the mountain to Bethany.</p> <p>There was a beautiful reunion between Mary and Martha and Lazarus. But the people in the town were the same kind of people. Some said, \"Good, Mary's back!\" But more of them said, \"Watch out for Mary!\" How did Mary succeed in not letting the gossip get her down? How did she manage to retain her peace of mind?</p> <p>Jesus had taught her the secret--that communication with God each day would bring her power over her problems and worries. How could she communicate with God even when Jesus wasn't in town? Through the same way we can today, by a meaningful devotional time of Bible study and prayer, talking with God and listening to Him, and then sharing with others.</p>","22"
"1","23","Only One Thing Needful","Faith That Works","<p><em>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</em> Luke 10:42.</p> <p>One day Jesus and His disciples came on the long trip up from Jericho to Bethany. Martha thought it would be a good idea to invite them over for dinner, because they'd all get a chance to know one another better. When Martha asked Jesus to get Mary to help in the kitchen, Martha was troubled. She was worried about making a good impression on Jesus. But Jesus replied, \"There is only one thing needful . . .\" This was His statement on the sum and substance, the beginning, the middle, and the end--everything concerning the Christian life. There's only one thing that is necessary in the Christian life, but it's also the one thing that many of us haven't tried yet.</p> <p>\"I can't sit at Jesus' feet now. He's not in town!\" Oh, yes; yes, you can! Please remember that all the intangible phrases we use in describing the Christian life--\"coming to Christ,\" \"sitting at Jesus' feet,\" \"giving Him your heart or your will\"--are made tangible by three things that we can do. How do we know one another better? By communicating and by doing things together. The same is true in getting to know God--communication with Him at the beginning of every day through Bible study and prayer. You study about the life of Jesus as given in the Bible, especially in the Gospels, and apply it to your own life, your own experiences, your own wants and needs, and then you talk with God about what you've learned. Then share with your friends what you've received from your personal encounter with God. Telling them what Jesus has done for you will make them desire to seek Him for themselves.</p> <p>Someone asks, \"Won't we do anything else besides read the Bible and pray?\" Of course we will! There are plenty of other things that are necessary--good works, obedience, high standards, doctrines of the church. But all these will grow out of this one needful thing, sitting at the feet of Jesus. It is the basis of the entire Christian experience. And many of us don't realize it yet; we don't think the Christian life can be that simple. But Mary had realized her need for that \"good part,\" as Jesus said, and it wouldn't be taken away from her.</p>","23"
"1","24","Spiritual Prescription","Faith That Works","<p><em>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</em> Romans 4:5.</p> <p>If you want to produce apples, the best thing for you to do is to find an apple tree somewhere. And if you want to produce the right kind of fruit in the Christian life, the best thing for you to do is to be a Christian. Because an apple tree, remember, bears apples because it is an apple tree, never in order to be an apple tree. And a Christian does what is right because he is a Christian, never in order to be a Christian. The problem of so many young people today is that they're trying to do what is right in order to be Christians.</p> <p>So what is the real faith that works? Faith is best defined as trust. The question is, How do we learn to trust? We learn to trust someone else by learning to know him. And we don't usually really trust anyone until we know him. God is one who is completely trustworthy, but you'll never believe that until you know Him. If you know God, you will trust Him, and you will trust Him spontaneously. If you don't know God, you will distrust Him. Whenever you see a person giving evidence of distrust of God, he is advertising the fact that he doesn't know God.</p> <p>When you really catch a glimpse of what Christianity is all about, you realize that it is involved in knowing Jesus. There are many professed Christians who will scrap it at that point, and will say, No, thanks; I want a religion, I want a Christianity, in which I can do something for myself. It is ego-deflating to come to Jesus and say, \"Lord, I guess You're right. I guess I can't do it. I would like to turn it all over to You.\"</p> <p>Now, how is this done? Here is where we get elementary. Here is the prescription: Take time, alone, at the beginning of every day, to seek Jesus through His Word and through prayer. That is all you can do, with the surrender of your will, to be a Christian. There is nothing else you can do to be a Christian. If you don't do that, you're not a Christian. All you are is a good liver. And there are a lot of good livers in the church who don't know God, who don't care a whole lot about the Lord Jesus Christ. God invites you to be more than simply a good liver. He invites you to know His presence and power in your life today, every day--that is Christianity.</p>","24"

Jesus is there, and Mary is at Jesus' feet. Her heart is breaking because she's heard Jesus talk about going to Jerusalem, where evil men will put Him to death. Mary heard--when even His disciples refused to listen. And she can't stand the thought, for Jesus is her best Friend.</p> <p>She doesn't like the synthetic custom of sending flowers after loved ones have gone. So you see her slipping quietly across the room to where Jesus is sitting. She carries the precious box of ointment, and thinks that if she's careful, no one will ever know.</p> <p>And that's where her plan goes wrong. Whenever you open a box of spikenard, it screams. Suddenly all eyes are upon her, including Simon's at the head of the table. The guests begin to murmur as she pours the ointment over Jesus' head and feet.</p> <p>That's when she discovers she'd forgotten something else, too--she has no towel, or anything else like it with her. In those days, only a woman of the streets would let her long, flowing hair down, but Mary never gives it a thought. She lets down her hair and wipes up the ointment. Imagine her there in her embarrassment. Everyone is staring at her and whispering, and down there at the other end of the table Simon is thinking, If this man Jesus knows what kind of woman she is and yet still allows her to touch Him, He must not be a prophet! It seems strange that anyone with Simon's record could have thought that way, but he did.</p> <p>\"Mary knew not the full significance of her deed of love. She could not answer her accusers. She could not explain why she had chosen that occasion for anointing Jesus. The Holy Spirit had planned for her, and she had obeyed His promptings.\"--<em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 560. Christ explained to Mary, and to those present, the meaning of her act. \"And as He went down into the darkness of His great trial, He carried with Him the memory of that deed, an earnest of the love that would be His from His redeemed ones forever.\"--<em>Ibid</em>.</p>","25"

And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her\" (Luke 10:38-42).</p> <p>What would you do if you heard that Jesus was in town? Where would you be? Would you be sleeping on the sidewalk in front of wherever He was going to appear, or would you be on your way out of town?</p> <p>Martha made certain that Jesus received an invitation to her house. And then she left Him sitting in the living room and went out to the kitchen, to do what Martha types do out in the kitchen. But you see here that Martha's concern was not just about the kitchen, and Mary helping, for she was troubled about many things. She was troubled about everything. When Jesus gently rebuked her, He wasn't simply talking about the kitchen and the pots and the pans. He was talking about a way of life for Martha. Martha was a good girl. She wouldn't think of doing anything wrong. Probably the worst thing she ever did was chew her fingernails when the mixer didn't work.</p> <p>Often good people feel that they don't need Jesus. They can get along fine being religious. But that thoughtful hour alone with Jesus every day is not something we do in addition to being Christians. It is the entire basis of the Christian life. Those who don't know what that is are invariably going to be careful and troubled about many things. There is only one way to victory and peace in the Christian life. Do you know what it is to sit at Jesus' feet, today, tomorrow, and every day until Jesus comes?</p>","26"

There He met the man who had led Mary of Magdala into sin. Simon--wretched Simon--now a victim of leprosy. We would have let him suffer by the side of the road. Simon didn't deserve healing! Yet the same power that cast the devils out of Mary and raised Lazarus from the dead cleansed Simon from leprosy. And Jesus healed Simon before he had even accepted Him as Messiah, as his Lord and Saviour, or as anything!</p> <p>This miracle created a real problem for Simon, because a Pharisee, a legalist, who has been used to earning what he gets all his life, is going to be driven up the wall when someone gives him something free. You see Simon lying awake at night, you see him making a path across his plush carpets during the day, trying to figure out what to do. He can't stand it--he's been given something.</p> <p>Finally, he has a bright idea. He'll pay Jesus back! He didn't have a chance to earn it, but he'll pay Him back. So he plans a huge banquet in honor of Jesus. There, the reaction of Jesus to Mary's anointing His feet gave Simon reason to justify his rejection of the Christ.</p> <p>At that moment Jesus turned to Simon and said, \"Simon, I have something to say.\" And Simon got tight stomach muscles. He'd heard about this Man--this Man who could read people's thoughts. Simon stiffened. He expected to be humiliated in his own house, at his own feast, in front of everybody. He was already beginning to feel the pain and embarrassment when Jesus, in a kind, tender manner, simply told him a little story--a story that only Simon could understand, but did he ever understand it! It went deep down into his heart, and for the first time, Simon saw himself as he really was. And he saw himself in the presence of Someone who knew what he was really like but who still loved him, who showed kindness and tenderness in not publicly tearing the mask from his face. His heart was broken, and he was converted right there at his own banquet. Jesus got Simon, too!</p>","27"

Believest thou this?</em> John 11:26.</p> <p>A certain man was sick, a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister, Martha. It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick.</p> <p>The <em>Desire of Ages</em> tells us that from their very first meeting, Lazarus' faith in Christ was strong; he became one of the most steadfast of Christ's disciples (page 524). All of them--Mary, Martha, and Lazarus--became close friends of Jesus, and whenever He came to Bethany, He went to see them. They were united in a close bond of fellowship and love.</p> <p>Jesus did a lot of traveling, and He was far away from Judea, where Bethany is, when Lazarus became ill. Mary and Martha sent a message to Jesus, \"He whom You love is sick.\" Surely because Jesus loved them so much, He would come back immediately to heal Lazarus. But Jesus sent back the words, \"This sickness is not unto death.\" They rushed to Lazarus' bedroom. \"Lazarus, can you hear us?\" \"Yes.\" \"Don't worry, Lazarus, you're not going to die. Jesus said so.\"</p> <p>And then he died. That must have been hard to take. The person who doesn't sit at Jesus' feet invariably ends up getting mad at God, blaming God for allowing all his troubles. But for the one who sits at Jesus' feet, it's different. And despite the shock and grief they must have been feeling, Mary and Martha did not waver in their faith; they did not blame Jesus for Lazarus' death.</p> <p>After an unhurried wait of two days, Jesus said to His disciples, \"We're going back to Bethany now. Lazarus is asleep.\" His disciples thought Jesus was talking about sleep in terms of resting, and couldn't understand why Jesus wanted to go to wake him up. Finally Jesus said reluctantly, in language they were familiar with, \"Lazarus is dead. But I'm going to wake him up.\"</p> <p>Jesus went back to Bethany and was met by Mary and Martha. Their faith had remained despite their loss. You know the rest of the story. The stone was rolled away, and Lazarus was awakened to life. What we call death is only a temporary separation. It's not eternal. And each of us can look forward to the great reunion when Jesus comes again.</p>","28"
"1","29","Why Jesus Wept","Faith That Works","<p><em>Jesus wept.</em> John 11:35.</p> <p>When Jesus went with Mary and Martha to the tomb of Lazarus, Jesus knew what plans He had for turning the scene of sorrow into one of rejoicing. Yet we see in the Bible record that \"Jesus wept.\" How could this be?</p> <p>Jesus wasn't afraid that Lazarus was stuck there, behind that stone. What we call death is no problem to God. Death has never been any problem to God. Raising Lazarus to life was probably one of the easiest things on earth that Jesus ever did. And when the Lord Himself descends from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and the dead in Christ come forth from their sleeping beds, wherever they are, that will be one of the easiest things that God has ever done.</p> <p>The only problem for God that still goes on is unbelief. That's the problem. It's a far greater miracle to see a person go from skepticism and atheism to Jesus, far greater than the raising of Lazarus. Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus because of the unbelief.</p> <p>They said, \"Oh, He's weeping because He loved him.\" No, that wasn't why He was weeping. He was weeping because of the people in the crowd that didn't believe. They did not accept what He had to offer. As He had said, \"Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.\"</p> <p>There was another reason why Jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus. He wept in sympathy with those who were hurting. Not only with Mary and Martha but with all the sorrowing of all ages, as His glance swept over the centuries, seeing the pain of the human family for ages to come.</p> <p>His love was so great that He sympathized with the sorrow of His friends, even though He knew it would last but a little while. He longs to relieve the distress of each of His children. He weeps, today, with those of us who weep. And because of the sacrifice He made in our behalf, we have the promise of a time and a place where all our tears will be wiped away.</p>","29"
"1","30","When Jesus Wept for Satan","Faith That Works","<p><em>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.</em> Isaiah 53:3.</p> <p>After sin and rebellion entered our universe, after there had been war in heaven, and after Satan and his angels had been cast out, Satan was not satisfied with what he had accomplished. He experienced no genuine sorrow that he had sinned and hurt Someone who loved him, but he became terrified as he saw the results, even from that point, of his rebellion.</p> <p>\"Satan trembled as he viewed his work. He was alone in meditation upon the past, the present, and his future plans. His mighty frame shook as with a tempest. An angel from heaven was passing. He called him and entreated an interview with Christ. This was granted him. He then related to the Son of God that he repented of his rebellion and wished again the favor of God.\" Now notice: \"Christ wept at Satan's woe but told him, as the mind of God, that he could never be received into heaven. Heaven must not be placed in jeopardy.\"--<em>The Story of Redemption</em>, p. 26.</p> <p>Jesus wept--at the beginning of the separation and sorrow caused by sin; as He looked ahead and saw Adam and Eve forced to leave the beautiful Garden He had created with them in mind; as He saw Cain, unable to tolerate the righteous Abel, violently ending his brother's life, and then refusing to repent.</p> <p>He saw the growing wickedness of the world, the wars, the crimes, the hatred, until all but eight souls were destroyed from the earth.</p> <p>He saw those in misery, in slavery, the masses who looked with longing eyes for a Deliverer, and yet rejected Him when He appeared among them.</p> <p>He saw Gethsemane, Calvary. He saw how few would accept His sacrifice, and how feeble was the faith of even the few. He wept because of the unbelief, the sorrow, the fear, the pain. He saw martyrs suffering for His sake. He saw those who denied Him to escape suffering.</p> <p>He sorrowed because Satan, whom He still loved, could not be saved. His heart was broken with the pain of separation from a loved one, from an unnumbered multitude of loved ones, with whom He could never be reunited. What a tremendous commentary on the love of God is the statement \"Jesus wept.\"</p>","30"
"1","31","The Man of Sorrows","Faith That Works","<p><em>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.</em> Isaiah 53:4.</p> <p>It is evening. The sun is setting and the sky is ablaze with color. The hearts of Jesus' disciples are also ablaze. Never have their hopes been so high, their plans and dreams seemed so sure of speedy fulfillment.</p> <p>They've put up with quite a bit these past three years, and at times it has hardly seemed worth it. But now they are on their way to Jerusalem. Jesus is traveling as a king, on a donkey, and multitudes have joined the twelve and are shouting their support. Surely now the new government will be set up.</p> <p>The procession pauses at the crest of the hill. The sounds of praise are quieted momentarily as the people see the sunset, and the sunset reflected from the white marble of the Temple. For a moment they look in pride and admiration; then they turn to see their own sentiments reflected in the face of Jesus.</p> <p>Jesus is weeping. Not the glistening eye with the smiling face that speaks tears of joy. But agony. Sobs. Sorrow so deep that it could find expression only in open grief. The people are stunned. Jesus had wept at the tomb of Lazarus, and they had understood that time--or thought they understood. But this is different. They look quickly at the disciples, searching for a clue. What has happened that perhaps they missed? But the faces of the disciples wear the same expression of puzzlement.</p> <p>From our vantage point in time, knowing what was about to take place, we might associate His sorrow with the sheepgate, beside the Temple. But <em>The Desire of Ages</em>, page 576, says, \"The tears of Jesus were not in anticipation of His own suffering.\" As we continue the inspired commentary, we discover that Jesus is weeping in an anguish of separation as He looks upon His children, whom He cannot save because they will not let Him. His glance takes in the sorrow of a world separated from God, from that moment to this. And to the Jews who would cry, \"Crucify Him,\" to the people of all ages who have turned every one to his own way, yes, to you and to me, who are simply too busy to find time for God, Jesus uttered the cry of a God with a breaking heart, \"How can I give thee up? How often would I have gathered thee, even as a hen gathereth her chicks, but you would not.\"</p>","31"
"2","4","Fulfilled and Fulfilling","The Promises of God","<p><em>While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. (Genesis 8:22)</em></p> <p>One morning after a terrific thunderstorm a little child came downstairs and asked, \"Daddy, what was God doing last night? Was He making the morning?\" The father replied, \"Yes, dear, I guess He was.\"</p> <p>This is the promise of God: Day and night, the seasons one after another, will come. The earth had just been devastated by the Flood, the routine of life destroyed. Noah looked upon the scene of desolation and then turned to God in worship. Soon the smoke of his sacrifice ascended, and his faith was shown by his works. The great curse of the Flood was gone, and the Lord promised new blessings. The seasons and the succession of day and night are to continue as long as the earth endures. Sunset and sunrise, sunrise and sunset, is the record of history and astronomy. God's promise has not failed, nor will it fail. Whenever we see the sunrise let us remember God's promise.</p> <p>\"Seedtime and harvest\" make life possible. \"Summer and winter, and day and night\" are His fulfilled promises. The God of Noah is the God of nature, the God of fulfilled and fulfilling promises.</p> <p>Over a fireplace in Princeton University is a motto written by Albert Einstein, which reads, \"God is a scientist, not a magician.\" God's ways of upholding the universe we call the laws of nature; they are not erratic; they are dependable because they are based upon His promises. Modern science would be impossible if they were not.</p> <p>Let us learn from Noah to make God first in our lives.</p>

"2","6","The Staff of Life","The Promises of God","<p><em>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. (Matthew 4:4)</em></p> <p>Bread, the staff of life, represents food and everything that man needs for physical life--even the land on which the food grows. Leo Tolstoy tells of a land-hungry man who went to a distant country where, for a thousand rubles, he was offered all the land he could walk around in a day. He was to put his money down on a certain spot and then walk until sunset. When he returned to the money all the land enclosed by his footsteps would be his. So the man started walking fast, then he ran, hurrying with all his strength. After great exertion he returned to the point of departure just as the sun was setting, but the task had been too great for him. He fell dead where he had started. Then all he could claim was a plot of ground six by three feet.</p> <p>Our heavenly Father knows that we have need of bread. He knows also that we cannot \"live by bread alone.\" We have a spiritual hunger that can never be satisfied with material things. Jesus said, \"A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth\" (Luke 12:15). He also said, \"I am the bread of life\" (John 6:35). \"Give us this day our daily bread\" is a prayer to be daily prayed and daily answered. \"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart\" (Jeremiah 15:16).</p>

"2","8","The Greatest Discovery","The Promises of God","<p><em>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow: though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. (Isaiah 1:18)</em></p><p>Sir James Simpson, the celebrated Scotch surgeon and scientist who was one of the pioneers in the medical use of anesthetics, was once asked by a young man what he considered his greatest discovery. His simple reply was, \"My greatest discovery was that I am a sinner, but that Jesus is a great Saviour.\"</p><p>God wants to reason with us about our sins, and this He does in today's promise--God's promise to everybody, for \"all have sinned\" (Romans 3:23). It is a matter of life and death, \"for the wages of sin is death\" (Romans 6:23).</p><p>Here is God's promise that when we meet the conditions our sins \"as scarlet . . . shall be as white as snow.\" That means forgiveness, cleansing, a new life out of death. But we must admit our need by coming to Christ. He came to do the will and work of God on earth, and He says: \"All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out\" (John 6:37). These are His wonderful words to us. Shall we not come to Him? You see, that is our part of it. We must make the decision. Why not come to Him now? He says Now--\"Come now.\" Tomorrow never comes. Anything that we ever do will be done now. We live in the path of a point, and that point is now. \"Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation\" (2 Corinthians 6:2).</p><p>It is said that if one looks at a red rose through a piece of scarlet glass the rose will look white. When God looks at our sins, \"red like crimson,\" through the atoning sacrifice of the cross, they appear \"as white as snow.\" And this is the reason: \"Christ died for our sins\" (1 Corinthians 15:3).</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin\" (Psalm 85:2).</p>","39"
"2","11","Look to Jesus","The Promises of God","<p><em>Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles</em>(Isaiah 42:1).</p><p>This is a prophecy of Christ. How wonderful it is in the mouth of Isaiah, spoken seven long centuries before Jesus was cradled in the Bethlehem manger. \"Behold My servant,\" said the Lord. \"Look upon Him. I uphold Him. He is My elect. I delight in Him. I have put My spirit upon Him. He shall bring forth judgment and righteousness to the nations.\" Who could this be but Jesus?</p><p>In Isaiah's day Israel sought to confine the blessings of God to their own nation, but the coming Saviour is for all men. His gospel is to go forth to all and bring righteousness to them. The command of God here is really, \"Look to Jesus.\" In Hebrews 3:1 we have almost the same words, \"Consider . . . Christ Jesus.\" Of those who crucified Jesus, it was prophesied in Zechariah 12:10, \"They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.\" And all His followers today are uged by the apostle to \"look for the Saviour\" (Philippians 3:20). We should all be \"looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God\" (Hebrews 12:2). Where are we looking? At Christ or at some of the failings of His followers?</p><p>Once when Mr. Astor was fording the Susquehanna River on horseback he became dizzy and almost lost his balance from looking at the swirling waters below. A hunter traveling with him struck him on the chin and shouted, ALook up!\" He did so and recovered his equilibrium. From the dizzy world that swirls about us, we need to look up to Christ. In Him is God's spirit; in Him is our righteousness; in Him is life.</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul\" (Psalm 86:4).</p>","42"

They believed the majority report of the committee of spies and planned to appoint a pro-Egyptian leader to take them back to the land of bondage. There were giants in the Land of Promise, and the Israelites were afraid of giants. The official report of the committee said, \"We were in our own sight as grasshoppers\" (Numbers 13:33). They had the grasshopper complex, and one is never so much like a grasshopper as when he feels like one.</p><p>Now, what about the march to the Promised Land? It seemed that the grasshopper men had ruined everything. God was about to destroy them, but Moses interceded for the backsliders. He reminded the Lord that all the unbelieving world was looking on and would say that God did not bring them into Canaan because He could not, that He was a limited God. And the Lord answered him, \"I have pardoned according to thy word: but as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord\" (Numbers 14:20, 21).</p><p>So, friend, we may fail God, but God's glory will not fail. Egypt, the desert, the hunger, the thirst, the endless marching, the Amalekites, the mixed multitude, the fiery serpents, the subversive report, the grasshopper men--yes, all of that and more!

(Matthew 5:6)</em></p><p>Have you ever seen anyone really hungry? In some parts of this earth such people may be seen every day. Millions of them have been hungry all their lives and are hungry at this very moment. Hollow-eyed, they hold out their hands in earnest appeal for something to eat.</p><p>We must continually eat and drink, or die. Too much hunger or too much thirst is a terrible thing, but a certain amount is good. God created man and the animals with hunger as part of their nature, and a wise provision it was too. Without the urge of hunger, food would not be taken, and death by starvation would ensue. Even intelligent man would soon vanish from the earth. He eats what he likes and because he is hungry. And so by nature he eats, in general, that which sustains life. By and large, hunger and thirst are good. They drive men to eat and drink, and so to live.</p><p>But notice our promise text: \"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.\" Here is a real blessing, a spiritual blessing. Without a spiritual hunger and thirst no one will ever be filled. It is blessed to have this divine hunger. Jesus said, \"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him\" (John 6:44). Then, speaking of this God-implanted thirst for God and righteousness, He continues, \"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink\" (John 7:37).</p><p>What does this promise mean to you, to me? The real question is, Are we hungry? Are we thirsty? If we are, we shall be filled.</p><blockquote>Are you hungry?--Come and eat,<br />The Bread of Heaven see;<br />Are you thirsty?--Come and drink,<br />The Word of God is free.</blockquote><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER:</strong> \"Oh that men would praise the Lord. . . .

Knox was fully worthy of the verdict of the Regent Morton, who, as he saw him laid in the grave, exclaimed, \"There lies he who never feared the face of man.\" Why was John Knox so fearless before men? Because by faith he had looked upon the face of God.</p><p>In any warfare what a wonderful promise is our text! Israel was about to cross over Jordan and meet seven enemy nations. They would need courage; and more than that, they would need the help of the Lord. This was promised to them and gloriously fulfilled. We need to be strong and of good courage. Why should we ever be afraid while obeying God's Word?</p><p>Notice, there is a threefold promise in this text:</p>
<ol><li>The Lord will go with us.</li>
<li>He will not fail us.</li>
<li>He will not forsake us. </ol>
<p>Jesus knew that His Father was with Him. \"I am not alone,\" He said, \"because the Father is with me\" (John 16:32). No one will be lonely or afraid when he realizes that God is with him.</p><p>Last, and most important of all, He will not forsake us. Human helpers may forsake us in a crisis, or leave us through very weariness. But never God! He is \"the Lord thy God.\" He is the ever-present helper who never fails, never forsakes. \"Trust ye in the Lord for ever: for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength\" (Isaiah 26:4).</p>

When a true artist paints such a landscape, he puts in some suggestion of a path to carry the eye out of the picture. Otherwise the tangle of trees and undergrowth would suffocate us, or the wide, trackless spaces dismay us. So God provides a way of escape for His children.</p><p>The way of life is often rough, but the Lord will keep our feet. If we surrender all our ways to Him, He will be our guard and guide. Not only will He give His angels charge to keep us (Psalm 91:11), but He Himself will preserve our goings, He will keep our feet from falling. He will pluck our feet out of the net set by crafty foes (Psalm 25:15) and set them on the solid rock of faith. \"He brought me up also . . . out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings\" (Psalm 40:2). He will not suffer our feet to be moved from the way of life (Psalm 66:9). He will guide our feet by His Word. \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path\" (Psalm 119:105). He will make our feet like hinds' feet so that we can run the way of His commandments (Psalm 18:33). He will make beautiful the feet of those who bring good tidings (Isaiah 52:7), for they are \"shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace\" (Ephesians 6:15). And He will keep the feet of His saints in many other ways. God will lead us in \"the way everlasting\" (Psalm 139:24).</p>

Wherever the cross went, the rainbow went. So each of our afflictions is a cross, but each cross is surrounded with the rainbow of God's promise.</p><p>Afflictions are afflictions. They do afflict us, pain us, try us, test us. Call affliction by any other name, and it is still something hard to endure.

He did not walk forth, for he was bound with graveclothes, which had to be loosened before he could move. He came forth by the power of God. Not one of God's children will be forgotten. They will all hear the call of the Life-giver.</p><p>On his seventieth birthday Victor Hugo wrote: \"Winter is on my head, but eternal spring is in my heart. The nearer I approach the end, the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me.\" The true Christian always has eternal spring in his heart, because the nearer he gets to the end of this life, the nearer he approaches the beginning of another--an immortal life, which is the gift of God. Our Saviour said: \"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die\" (John 11:25, 26).</p><p>The Holy Scriptures answer the question Will men live again? Yes, they will live. But when? Our answer, as far as God's people are concerned, is found in John 6:40: \"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\"</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness\" (Psalm 17:15).</p>","52"
"2","22","The Path of Life","The Promises of God","<p><em>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore</em> (Psalm 16:11).</p><p>A father in Watford, England, was greatly troubled about his son who had gone wrong. The boy was far away, ill, and despondent. He wrote his father fearfully asking whether there was any hope of a reconciliation. The father sent him a telegram of just one word, \"Home,\" and it was signed \"Father.\" The gospel of Jesus Christ is God's telegram to a sinful world. It is summed up in one word, \"Home,\" and is signed by one word, \"Father\"--even <em>our</em> Father in heaven.</p><p>God alone knows the path of life. Men have traced many paths, and millions have plodded their sad miles for thousands of years, finding at the end that all their \"yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death.\" He who is the living God, and He alone, knows and shows the path of life. \"In him was life; and the life was the light of men\" (John 1:4). \"As the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself\" (John 5:26). The path of life is revealed in the words of Christ, \"The words that I speak unto you, . . . they are life\" (John 6:63).</p><p>Are you acquainted with \"fulness of joy\"? God's path of life leads to joy here and now--joy in His service, joy even in suffering and disappointment. \"Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations [or trials]\" (James 1:2; see 1 Peter 1:6-8). \"For the kingdom of God is . . . joy in the Holy Ghost\" (Romans 14:17). This joy of believers cannot be explained; it is a \"joy unspeakable and full of glory\" (1 Peter 1:8). And the path of life leads on to the very right hand of God above, where we enter into the joy of the Lord (Matthew 25:21) and find in His presence \"pleasures for evermore.\"</p><p>In His word, God has clearly shown us the path of life. Let us follow it today, for \"the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day\" (Proverbs 4:18).</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation\" (Psalm 13:5).</p>","53"
"2","23","Ye Shall Receive Power","The Promises of God","<p><em>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth </em>(Acts 1:8).</p><p>At a large open-air meeting in Liverpool a skeptic gave a strong address against Christianity. At the close he said, \"If any man here can say a single word in favor of Jesus Christ, let him come out and say it.\" Not a soul spoke, and the silence became oppressive. Then two young girls arose and walked hand in hand up to the speaker and said, \"We can't speak, but we can sing for Christ.\" Immediately they began: \"'Stand up! stand up for Jesus!'\" When that song ceased, nearly every head was uncovered and the vast throng was deeply moved, many sobbing. The crowd melted and quietly went away. The promise of power for witnessing is one of the greatest promises ever made to God's servants.</p><p>The Holy Spirit was promised by our Saviour just before He returned to His Father after fulfilling His atoning sacrifice on earth. On the day of Pentecost, not long afterward, the promise was fulfilled; and the waiting, praying disciples were endued with power from on high\" (Luke 24:49; see Acts 2). The outpouring of the Holy Spirit was the divine signal that Christ's sacrifice was accepted of God.</p><p>With this witness and this power these humble disciples went forth into a hostile and unbelieving world and shook it to its foundations. Notice, the power of Pentecost was power for witnessing. The gift of tongues enabled them to preach the gospel to thousands. \"Ye shall receive power, . . . and ye shall be witnesses unto me.\" The power of the Holy Spirit is not for personal glory or selfish enjoyment; it is an enabling to witness for Christ. It is for witnessing and for witnesses only. If we have no certainty, no evidence, no witness of Christ, we shall receive no power. The promised power and presence of the Holy Spirit are for us as we go witnessing for Christ.</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long\" (Psalm 71:24).</p>","54"
"2","24","In All Thy Ways","The Promises of God","<p><em>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths</em> (Proverbs 3:5, 6).</p><p>William T. Stead, who went down on the <em>Titanic</em>, was asked to become editor of the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> in London. He consulted his friend, Dean Church, about it, and after their interview Mr. Stead expressed his assurance that he would be divinely guided. The dean was astonished at his certainty. \"I should feel swindled,\" said Mr. Stead, \"if I were not so led.\"</p><p>\"Why so?\" asked the dean.</p><p>\"Why? I read in the book of Proverbs: 'In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.' I have acknowledged Him, and I know that I shall be directed.\"</p><p>One of the hardest lessons to learn in this life is to trust God fully. It is so easy, so natural, to lean on our own understanding. \"Be not afraid, only believe\" (Mark 5:36) is the medicine we need. The real test is the Lord's demand for \"<em>all</em> thine heart.\" The same divine requirement is repeated in the last verse of our text: \"In <em>all</em> thy ways acknowledge him.\" If God is not in <em>all</em> our ways, He is not in our ways <em>at all</em>. In little things, as well as the large, we are privileged to acknowledge God. He is interested in us twenty-four hours a day, sixty minutes of the hour, sixty seconds of the minute.</p><p>He watches over all our life's journey, from the first uncertain step of babyhood to the last uncertain step of old age. He knows all about us, gives us all blessings, and leads us all through life if we desire and permit Him to do so. Why then should we not acknowledge Him? \"O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps\" (Jeremiah 10:23). Then let us ask the Lord to direct them. \"A man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps\" (Proverbs 16:9).</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not\" (Psalm 17:5).</p>","55"
"2","25","Never Wasted","The Promises of God","<p><em>Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days</em> (Ecclesiastes 11:1).</p><p>In 1855 a Bible colporteur went to Toulon, France, and sold copies of the New Testament to the soldiers embarking for the Crimean War. One soldier asked him what the book might be. \"The Word of God,\" he said.</p><p>\"Let me have it,\" was the reply. Then he added with a laugh, \"Now it will do very well to light my pipe.\"</p><p>The colporteur was sorry and thought his efforts wasted. A year later he was working in central France and sought lodging at an inn. The family in charge were in great distress at the death of their son, who had been wounded in the Crimea and had come home to die. \"But we have much consolation,\" said the mother, \"because he was so peaceful and happy.\"</p><p>\"How was that?\" asked the colporteur.</p><p>\"He said he found all his comfort in one little book that he always carried with him.\"
The colporteur asked to see it, and was brought a copy of the New Testament. The last twenty pages had been torn out, but on the inside of the cover were these words: \"Received at Toulon [with the date]; despised, neglected, read, believed, and found salvation.\" The place and date were recognized by the colporteur.</p><p>All your acts, words, and thoughts will return to you sometime, somewhere. The great river of time may seem to carry away all the precious fruit of your hard labor, but do not despair or cease to cast your bread upon the rolling waters. Somewhere it will feed the hungry.</p><p>Put your heart into the Lord's service; give your energy, your enthusiasm, your time, your treasure, your love, to Him. \"Cast thy bread upon the waters.\" God will watch over it, and the day will come when you will find it again on some far shore or near at hand.</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"Let my cry come near before thee, O Lord: give me understanding according to thy word\" (Psalm 119:169).</p>","56"
"2","26","Never Ashamed","The Promises of God","<p><em>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith</em>(Romans 1:16, 17).</p><p>A little church in a mining town of Bolivia was being dedicated. It was constructed of such material as the people had in hand. The floor and some of the furniture were made of shipping boxes for explosives used in the mines. When the preacher stepped behind the pulpit, he saw the words <em>Explosivos peligrosos</em> (\"Dangerous explosives\").</p><p>The gospel is \"the power of God unto salvation.\" The apostle Paul here uses the word for \"power\" from which our word \"dynamite\" is derived. The true gospel is the mighty power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, and the apostle was not ashamed of it, because he experienced its power in his own life and saw its transforming action in others.</p><p>The pagan world, with all its culture and degradation, could not resist the gospel. Hatred, persecution, ridicule, argument--nothing could destroy it. The gospel alone could meet the need of the sinful human heart. It was built on man's weakness and God's power. It was, and is, the answer to earth's great problem--how to find righteousness. \"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed . . . , The just shall live by faith.\" To be just is to be righteous, and this is no human attainment. \"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us\" (Titus 3:5).</p><p>Righteousness is always and only and forever by faith (Romans 10:10). It is imputed to us (Romans 4:22). It is imparted to us (Philippians 3:9). It is the righteousness demanded by the law of God, but not given by it. It bears the fruit of obedience (Romans 8:3, 4; cf. James 2:17, 18). O friend, you will never be ashamed of the gospel of Christ if you accept it as God's power for your life.</p><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"For thou.

<blockquote>Nothing before, nothing behind;<br />The steps of Faith<br />Fall on the seeming void, and find<br />The Rock beneath.</blockquote><div align=\"RIGHT\">--WHITTIER</div>
<p>Millions of people today are spiritually adrift. They have no sure haven for their souls. They have no solid anchor of truth, no clear conviction of right and wrong, of yes and no, of white and black; only a hopeless gray of indecision. It is not always popular to be positive.</p><p>The unhappiness of modern man comes directly from his lack of faith. Every one of us needs a refuge from the storms of life, and that refuge is faith in God. For peace of soul we must be able to say, A\"I know.\" The writer of today's text <em>knew</em> something. He knew that what God does He does for eternity. The things that God is doing now will reach fulfillment despite opposing forces. When we see God at work in the world, we should take courage and \"fear before him.\" We are too greatly influenced by the spirit of the age, by time. Man's ideas, ways, doings, are as changeable as the weather, but through daily study of God's Word and prayer we may keep in step with the Eternal on His march through the ages.</p>

"2","28","Fear: Satan's Weapon","The Promises of God","<p><em>Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord</em> (Jeremiah 1:8).</p><p>The visitor to Westminster Abbey sees many memorials to great men, but there is no nobler tribute than that inscribed on the monument to Lord Lawrence--simply his name, the date of his death, and these words: \"He feared man so little because he feared God so much.\"</p><p>Be afraid to be afraid! Conceit and pride are to be dreaded, but so is cowardice. Severe punishment is given to soldiers guilty of \"cowardice in the face of the enemy.\" Fear is one of Satan's chief weapons, and when it enters the heart we are in danger of falling into sin. The apostle Peter was overcome with fear and denied that he had ever known his Lord (Matthew 26:69-75).</p><p>Do they threaten you? Then it is time for boldness. \"And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word\" (Acts 4:29).</p><p>Should we ever \"be afraid of a man that shall die\" (Isaiah 51:12)? Are you afraid of losing your position? God will never suffer His servants to \"want any good thing\" (Psalm 34:10).</p><p>Do they ridicule you? Scorn and ridicule never killed God's servants of old (Job 16:20). Remember, Daniel stood alone in the lions' den when it would have been easier to go along with the crowd. The three young men on the plains of Dura stood for a conviction when it meant discord with the public orchestra.</p><p>So, let us fear to fear. God said to Jeremiah, \"Be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them\" (Jeremiah 1:17).</p><p>And what reason we have for bravery! \"I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.\" So, let us fall on our knees and cry for help.

Most were villagers who lived in poorly constructed homes with weak foundations. This is also true of the massive earthquake in Gansu, China, which registered an amazing 8.6 on the Richter scale and took 200,000 lives on December 16, 1920. The pattern is the same everywhere in the world. Whether it is Northern Peru, Central America, or southern Turkey, if the quality of the building is poor, the devastation is the greatest. Weak buildings do not survive earthquakes.</p><p>The same principle is true in our own spiritual lives. Some people do quite well when life goes well. They seem to thrive in life's good times, but when storms of difficulty crash on them, they fall apart. Why? Their spiritual experience is built on the weak foundation of their own human abilities. As long as their problems are no greater than their ability to cope, they do fine. When their problems grow larger than their inner strength, they crumble. Without a solid foundation they cannot cope with the seismic shocks of life.</p><p>God provides a solid foundation in His Word. As we meditate upon the truths of Scripture, we grow into mature Christians. God's Word gives our faith a strength and stability. It enables us to stand when the storms of life are fierce. It supports us when everything around is crumbling. Ellen White puts it this way: \"Our bodies are built up from what we eat and drink; and as in the natural economy, so in the spiritual economy: it is what we meditate upon that will give tone and strength to our spiritual nature\" (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 88).</p><p>Fill your mind with God's Word.

Anger, bitterness, and resentment yield to loving forgiveness, mercy, and tolerance. Selfish greed gives way to unselfish service. Crumbling marriages are renewed. Broken relationships are rekindled. Shattered self-esteem is restored. In God's Word, the weak find strength, the guilty find forgiveness, the discouraged find new joy, and the despairing find hope.

Applying these two simple principles will transform your attitude toward your Bible study time. The \"eyes\" of exciting Bible study are visualization and identification.</p><p>As you read the stories of the Bible, attempt to picture each scene in the narrative. Visualize the man stricken with palsy, shaking from head to toe as Jesus approaches. Picture the crowded marketplace in Jerusalem. Look through Jesus' eyes at the hungry multitude seated on the grassy slopes near the sea of Galilee. Rather than hurrying through a passage to get to the point, pause for a moment to observe these important scenes. As you visualize each scene, picture it in your mind, and try to identify with the Bible characters in the scene.</p><p>Imagine that you are the woman caught in adultery. Imagine that you are the thief on the cross. Imagine that you are the Roman centurion crucifying Christ. Get inside these characters. What would you feel if you were in their place? What would you be thinking if you were experiencing what they were going through? What if you were Daniel, unjustly condemned and thrown into the lions' den? How would you have felt if you were Moses, placing your feet in the Red Sea as it parted? Analyze the thoughts and feelings of the Bible characters. Put yourself in their places. Weep as they weep. Rejoice when they rejoice. Let your spirits soar with their triumphs and crash with their defeats. Seeing through new eyes will transform Bible study into an exciting adventure in faith.</p>","62"

Is there reliable information regarding names, places and geographical locations in Scripture? Discoveries in the past 200 years demonstrate the validity of God's Word. Archaeology does not prove the Bible is divinely inspired, but it does provide a basis for belief. Demonstrating the accuracy of scores of biblical details, it supports our faith. The past two centuries have provided us with a number of remarkable archaeological finds. Here are just a few.</p><p>The Moabite Stone, discovered in 1868 in Jordan, confirms the Moabite attacks on Israel as recorded in 2 Kings 1 and 3. This is hard evidence from outside the Bible of a specific event recorded by writers of Scripture. Following the death of Israel's king Ahab in 853 B.C., the king of Moab attacked Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. Through the miraculous intervention of God the Israelites Arose up and attacked the Moabites, so that they fled before them . . .\" 2 Kings 3:24 The Moabite Stone precisely records the Moabite defeat and their subsequent retreat as outlined in the Bible.</p><p>One of the most amazing finds of the twentieth century was the \"Lachish Letters,\" discovered from 1932 to 1938. These incredible documents found 24 miles north of Beersheba describe the attack of Nebuchadnezzar on Jerusalem in 586 B.C. They detail Jerusalem's fall from the perspective of Babylon. The Lachish Letters confirm the historical accuracy of Jerusalem's fall. They testify to the truthfulness of the inspired prophets in Chronicles, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, who spoke of Babylon's attack on Jerusalem.</p><p>Another almost unbelievable find is the Cyrus Cylinder, made of clay. This record describes Cyrus, the Persian king, including his overthrow of Babylon and the deliverance of the Jewish captives in 539 B.C. This archaeological find is especially significant when one considers that Cyrus was named more than 150 years before his birth, in Isaiah 44:27,28 and Isaiah 45:1 as God's chosen Ashepherd\" who would carry out the deliverance of Israel.</p><p>These discoveries, along with scores of others, continue to confirm the accuracy and reliability of the Bible.

He also took hundreds of artists, linguists, and scholars to help him better understand the history of that intriguing land. Relics of the past were everywhere, with their hidden mysteries of a once-great civilization. Strange inscriptions decorated monuments and temple walls, leaving Napoleon and his brain trust wondering what secret messages they contained.</p><p>In 1799 one of Napoleon's soldiers unearthed a black stone about four feet long and about two and a half feet wide that would unlock the mystery of Egyptian picture writing and reveal secrets hidden for centuries. That slab, known as the Rosetta Stone, is now housed in the British Museum in London, England. The Rosetta Stone bears an ancient decree in three different languages: hieroglyphics (Egyptian picture writing), cursive Egyptian, and Greek. Scholars quickly translated the Greek text, but puzzled over the hieroglyphics. Twenty years later, in 1822, a brilliant young French Egyptologist by the name of Jean Francois Chapollion startled the world by cracking the ancient code. With the language unveiled, scholars were able to verify biblical passages that had appeared questionable. Here is one striking example.</p><p>The Bible mentions a people called the Hittites about fifty times, discussing their dealings with Abraham, David, and Solomon. These biblical references picture the Hittites as one of the most powerful of ancient empires. Yet in all of the ancient historical records not a trace of them remained. Critics reasoned that it would be impossible for such a mighty empire to disappear from history without leaving a trace behind. They suggested that such a nation never existed. But then came the Rosetta Stone. The vast museum of monuments and pillars all along the Nile, its messages locked up in hidden languages for centuries, now opened their doors. Inscriptions on these pillars and palace walls speak repeatedly of the political and military conflicts between Pharoah Rames II and the \"King of Hitti,\" or the Hittites. Today the Hittites' place in history is well established.</p><p>

Daily the Word of God nourished his spiritual life. In one of his last letters he wrote, \"I am reading the Bible straight through from cover to cover.\" His words radiate with a joy in the Word. He added, \"I read the Psalms every day, as I have done for years. I know them and love them more than any other book.\"</p><p>The Bible strengthened Bonhoeffer to face the greatest trial of his life. He received spiritual strength and indomitable courage through God's Word. His faith was unshakable because it was rooted in the God who reveals Himself through His unchanging Word. Ellen White writes, \"If God's Word were studied as it should be, men [and women] would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times\" (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 90). The Bible gives an unusual spiritual strength. It brings depth to our spiritual lives.</p><p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer discovered the enormous benefits of prayerfully studying God's Word. God offers us the same opportunity. The spiritual giants of the past did not develop strong faith by chance. Their lives were rooted in God's Word. Their faith was strong because their devotional life was strong.</p><p>The same is true for us today. The same Holy Spirit who inspired the Scriptures, inspires us as we read God's Word. As we meditate on God's Word today our faith will be strengthened too.</p>","66"
"3","8","Truth Worth Everything","On Solid Ground","<p><em>Sanctify them by your truth. Your word is truth.</em> John 17:17.</p><p>In the early 1400s a bright young lecturer at the University of Prague discovered the writings of the English Reformer John Wycliffe. As John Huss pored over the Scriptures, he became personally convinced that the church in Bohemia badly needed a reformation. Several years after taking priest's orders he was appointed rector of the Bethlehem Chapel in Prague. The founders of this chapel advocated the preaching of the Scriptures in the language of the people. Although Huss was of humble birth and was left fatherless at a young age, he had an insatiable desire for knowledge. He had an unusually bright mind and outstanding communication skills. He was admitted to the university as a charity case, but soon distinguished himself as one of the University of Prague's scholars. </p><p>After completing his college course, he entered the priesthood and soon became attached to the court of the king. He was also made a professor of the university where he had received his education. He became a powerful preacher renowned throughout Europe. When he began to preach that many of the church's beliefs could not be reconciled with Scripture, it sent shock waves throughout the church in Europe.</p><p>Standing on the authority of Scripture alone, he boldly called for reform in the life and beliefs of fellow church members. Huss staunchly defended his position that \"the precepts of Scripture, conveyed through the understanding, are to rule the conscience; in other words, that God speaking in the Bible, and not the church speaking through the priesthood, is the one infallible guide\" (<em>The Great Controversy</em>, p. 102).</p><p>Huss's preaching led to violent opposition from the Roman Church. In 1415 he was burned at the stake in Prague, martyred for his faith.</p><p>Even in death John Huss had the absolute confidence that the truth that he believed, preached, and was willing to die for would one day triumph. God is calling us in our day to be passionate about obeying His truth in our age of moral decay. There are some things that are not worth compromising. The price is just too high.</p>","67"

This is my comfort in my affliction, for Your word has given me life.</em> Psalm 119:49, 50.</p><p>God's Word gives us hope in times of discouragement. It brings comfort in times of affliction. It imparts life in times of despair. </p><p>Pastor Pyoter Rumackik was imprisoned in a Soviet gulag for his faith. He discovered that even in our darkest times, God provides strength for our daily needs.</p><p>His experience became almost unbearable when prison officials took his Bible away. A few days later, a fellow prisoner handed him a notebook and said, \"Here, read this poem.\" The pastor glanced up and couldn't believe his eyes. It was a poem about Christ's sufferings on calvary. His spirit soared as he read it. He began flipping the pages and discovered more scripturally based poems and numerous passages of the Bible. They filled the entire notebook.</p><p>The unknown stranger announced, \"It's yours, you can keep it,\" and walked away. That notebook filled with Bible passages and scriptural truth brought Pyoter great comfort during the next few years. It helped give him many precious moments of fellowship with God.</p><p>Later the Christian pastor discovered, to his surprise, that the prisoner who gave him the notebook was an atheist. While working alone as a shepherd late at night in the Mongolian highlands, he became fascinated with Christian radio programs. They lifted his spirits and provided inspiration during his solitary nights. He would tape programs and copy portions in notebooks to pass the time. Somehow he managed to smuggle one of his notebooks into the prison. He then felt inspired to give it to Pyoter. For the pastor, this Mongol shepherd seemed like the ravens that brought food to the prophet Elijah in the wilderness. God found a way to provide for his needs. All the power of the gulag guards could not keep God's Word from penetrating his heart. The bars of a cell could not keep God's Word out. The shackles of a prison could not chain the Word of God. God's living Word provides strength for our daily needs in all of the varied circumstances of our lives.</p><p>As we read the precious promises of Scripture we too will declare, \"For Your word has given me life.\"</p>","68"
"3","10","The Scriptures Reveal Jesus","On Solid Ground","<p><em>You search the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of me. </em>John 5:39.</p><p>Every book has a central theme. The central theme of the Bible is Jesus Christ. It is the story of the perfect world He created, sin's rebellion, the consequences of disobedience, and the efforts of a loving God desperate to save His lost children. The Bible is the story of Jesus plunging into the arena of human affairs to save a people who could not save themselves. In a world of self-centeredness, Jesus revealed the selfless love of God. In a world that did not love Him, Jesus loved unconditionally. \"God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us\" (Romans 5:8).</p><p>I have seen this incredible love story touch the lives of millions around the world in our It Is Written evangelistic meetings. During our meetings in Madras, India, one of the local Bible instructors asked to be assigned to the worst area in town--a barrio known for its gangs, thieves, drugs, and drunkenness. One day while she was visiting people in that area, Jesus came face to face with the local gang leader. The gang leader confronted her and said, \"Old woman get out of here with your Jesus.\"</p><p>\"Young man,\" she replied, \"Tell me why you don't love Him as I do.\" The gang leader began to curse and yell. She patiently listened. When he calmed down, she told him about the Jesus who changed her life. The Jesus who filled her heart with love and joy and peace. The tough, hardened gang leader began to weep. \"Old woman, please come with me to all the gang members in this barrio to tell them about the love of Jesus, too.\"</p><p>The Christ of scripture transformed this doubter's heart. There is a love that flows from the pages of Scripture that changes our lives also. There is nothing we can do to change God's love for us. All of our sins will not keep Him from loving us.</p><p>The Bible speaks to us of a love so amazing, so incredible, so unparalleled, so matchless, so awesome that, if we let it, that love will change our lives.</p>","69"
"3","11","Enemies No More","On Solid Ground","<p><em>But God demonstrates His own love toward us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</em> Romans 5:8.</p><p>Martin Niemoller, a German Protestant theologian, languished for months in one of Hitler's prisons. During his imprisonment he spent days thinking about the questions of life and death. He reevaluated his life, meditating on God's enormous love for him. Quietly he prayed, \"Lord, I cannot resist your love any longer. I accept your forgiveness. I believe I am your child.\" Niemoller had struggled with the thought of his own inadequacy and guilt. He felt unworthy, sinful, and distant from God. But in a wretched prison camp he was spiritually transformed.</p><p>At last released from prison, Niemoller made this penetrating observation: \"It took me a long time to learn that God is not the enemy of His enemies.\" The apostle Paul outlines this truth marvelously. ABut God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life\" (Romans 5:8-10).</p><p>When we were His enemies, He was our friend. When we turned our backs on Him, He turned His face toward us. When we ran from Him, He ran to us. The glory of His grace is that He accepts the unacceptable, forgives the unforgivable and He loves the unlovable. Since we are forgiven, we can be forgiving. Since we are loved, we can be loving.</p><p>This thought is captured magnificently in <em>Steps to Christ</em>, page 15: \"Such love is without a parallel. Children of the heavenly King! Precious promise! Theme for the most profound meditation! The matchless love of God for a world that did not love Him! The thought has a sudbduing power upon the soul and brings the mind into captivity to the will of God.\" This is the gospel and the good news of grace.</p><p>God's unconditional, changeless love is the central theme of the Bible. When we open His Word, we come face to face with His love.</p>","70"
"3","12","Lonely No Longer","On Solid Ground","<p><em>Since you were precious in My sight, you have been honored, and I have loved you; therefore I will give men for you, and people for your life.</em> Isaiah 43:4.</p><p>Clara Anderson was a maid in San Francisco. She was a very gentle woman and very conscientious. One day, after having worked for the same employer for 15 years, she disappeared. She seemed to have just dropped out of sight. Then miraculously, after days of searching, the city's social services department found her.</p><p>Clara was in the process of starving herself to death in a mountain hideout outside of San Francisco. She said, \"I want to die, leave me alone.\" When a reporter interviewed her, Clara said, \"Look, nobody cares about me. I am just a maid, just one of thousands in society doing menial tasks. My life is of no value. I have no close relatives, no family, no friends. I'm so lonely that I don't want to live. There's no one I consider close to me, nobody I can talk to, nobody I can open my heart to. So just let me die, because nobody really cares.\"</p><p>There is good news for all the Clara Andersons of life. Somebody loves you more than you will ever realize. When God created you, He threw away the pattern. There is no one else like you in the universe. When the genes and chromosomes came together to form the unique biological structure of your personality, God made a one-of-a-kind you. You are special to Him. If He loses you there is no way to replace you. God looks at you and says that you are precious. You are honorable. You are loved.</p><p>\"He cares for each one as if there were not another on the face of the earth\" (<em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 480) and \"He watches over His children with a love that is measureless and everlasting\" (<em>The Ministry of Healing</em>, p. 482).</p><p>On those days when you feel alone, remember that the Creator of the universe loves you with an immense love. In those moments of your life when you feel like all hope is gone, remember that the Creator of the universe is your best friend. He is committed to your eternal happiness. He is interested in every aspect of your life. He longs to fill your life with a sense of purpose.</p><p>His plans for your life are bigger, greater, and higher than you can possibly imagine. Choose today to come out of your dark dungeon of despair into the bright, warm sunshine of His love. Simply put, He cares. Let Him fill your heart, and rejoice.</p>","71"
"3","13","Blessed Assurance","On Solid Ground","<p><em>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. </em>Hebrews 10:22.</p><p>One of the great Christian hymns is the well-known ABlessed Assurance.\" The melody was written by Mrs. Joseph Knapp. Her husband was the president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. One day Knapp invited the prolific hymn writer Fanny Crosby to her home. Knapp wanted her to listen to a new melody she had composed.</p><p>Knapp sat down at the piano and began playing the melody. As she played she asked Crosby what thoughts were coming into her mind--what did the melody suggest to her? Crosby responded, \"Mrs. Knapp, your husband deals in life insurance. My heavenly Father deals in assurance. This melody suggests to me: blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.\"</p><p>The word \"assurance\" means an inner confidence. Assurance is a sense of security. It also speaks of a sense of belonging and acceptance. In Christ, we are accepted as children of God. In Christ, we have the absolute confidence that our guilt is gone and our sins are forgiven. In Christ, we have complete assurance that the gift of eternal life is ours.</p><p>The book of Hebrews reveals that as children of God we can have \"the full assurance of hope until the end\" (Hebrews 6:11) and the Afull assurance of faith\" (Hebrews 10:22). It is certainly not God's will for His children to be filled with uncertainty. The plan of salvation offers much more than nervous anxiety regarding our salvation. God longs for us to be filled with assurance.</p><p>Satan hates it when a child of God accepts Christ by faith and receives the blessed assurance of forgiveness, pardon, and freedom from guilt. Ellen White wrote, \"Satan is ready to steal away the blessed assurances of God. He desires to take every glimmer of hope and every ray of light from the soul, but you must not permit him to do this. Do not give ear to the tempter, but say, 'Jesus has died that I might live. He loves me, and wills not that I should perish. I have a compassionate heavenly Father, and although I have abused His love, though the blessings He has given me have been squandered, I will arise, and go to my Father . . .'\" (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 53).</p><p>In the parable of the prodigal son the father accepted his boy back home. With his father's signet ring placed on his finger, the wayward son received the absolute assurance of his father's love. Like the prodigal son, we too find love, acceptance, and forgiveness in the Father's heart. What confidence, what security, what hope, what blessed assurance.</p>","72"
"3","14","Forgive As You Are Forgiven!","On Solid Ground","<p><em>And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgives you. </em>Ephesians 4:32.</p><p>Jacquie sat on one side of the room, the board members on the other. The chasm between them seemed almost impossible to span.</p><p>Jacquie had grown up in her hometown church, but the ties were severed when she left her first husband and married another man. Now, 20 years later, she desired rebaptism. She sobbed out her repentance and asked for forgiveness.</p><p>Silence followed. The board knew her situation well, the pain it had brought the congregation. Could they bridge the chasm?</p><p>I knew I had to speak. I spoke kindly but directly. \"She has suffered enough. Let's not give her any more pain. Paul's counsel is for us to be kind to one another, 'tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you' (Ephesians 4:32, KJV). If God, in all of His perfection, accepts and forgives us, we can forgive Jacquie.\"</p><p>With quivering lips, her voice cracking, she responded. \"I know I have done wrong,\" she said. \"For years I have felt guilty. At times the guilt has almost driven me crazy. Please accept me.\"</p><p>I noticed a tear in the first elder's eye. Then I realized that most of the church board were crying. Soon a chorus of voices responded in unison, \"Of course--of course we will accept you.\" Warmth, love, and acceptance filled the room. Board members reassured Jacquie of their love. Some hugged her. Others squeezed her hand in the warmth of Christian fellowship.</p><p>I stood back, recognizing again that our church was never more the church than at that moment. Here was the love of God in action. Here was Calvary demonstrated in the family of God.</p><p>As He hung dying on the cross Jesus prayed, \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do\" (Luke 23:34). Forgiveness is an attitude of mercy toward those who have wronged us. It releases others from our condemnation because Christ has released us from His condemnation. It treats others as they do not deserve, because Christ treats us as we do not deserve. The essence of Christianity is forgiving like Christ forgives, accepting like Christ accepted, and loving like Christ loved.</p>","73"
"3","15","No Excuses","On Solid Ground","<p><em>Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</em> Job 42:6.</p><p>A company found itself in the middle of tense negotiations with union leaders.

But here he is in the paper beside a caption describing his excellent golf score.\"</p><p>After a moment of silence a union man spoke up. \"Wow,\" he said, \"think of the score he could have had if he hadn't been sick!\"</p><p>Nice try! We can deny--we can try to cover up deceptions or our misbehavior. But it usually doesn't take us very far. Our sins have a way of finding us out. The wise man is abundantly clear: \"He who covers his sins will not prosper\" (Proverbs 28:13).</p><p>Hollow excuses really don't provide many substantial answers. Flimsy reasoning is sometimes used to cover the grossest sins.</p><p>John Wayne Gacy, Jr., was convicted of murdering scores of children in his Chicago home. He claimed innocence despite the discovery of 27 bodies in a crawl space under the house. How did he respond as he faced death by lethal injection? Gacy said, "In my heart, as God is my witness, I haven't killed anyone.\"</p><p>"It wasn't really me.\" \"I couldn't help myself.\" Such excuses have become all too common recently.</p><p>Scripture calls for something far different than lame excuses.</p><p>In a culture that often denies the reality of right and wrong, God calls for boldfaced, on-your-knees, heartfelt repentance. Repentance is a deep sorrow for sin. It is hurting because I have hurt the heart of God. It is weeping over my sins because God weeps over them. It is grieving over my sin because God grieves over it. It is feeling the pain of my sin because God has felt its pain.</p><p>Excuses only produce more guilt. Repentance leads to forgiveness. Forgiveness gives way to healing, and healing brings wholeness.</p>","74"

He allowed God's voice to guide him throughout his life. One night in his childhood he decided to take a shortcut across the moors on his way home. The area was noted for limestone quarries. He was familiar with the terrain and felt he could safely navigate his way.</p><p>Though the night was starless and inky-black, he set out through the rock and heather. He could sometimes hear the far-off bleating of a sheep and the wind rustling through the heather. Occasionally a moor fowl fluttered up noisily. Otherwise, he was very much alone in the night.</p><p>Suddenly he heard a voice call out with great urgency: \"Peter!\"</p><p>Halting, he called back into the dark, \"Yes, who is it? What do you want?\"</p><p>There was no response, just a bit of wind over the deserted moorland. He concluded he'd been mistaken and walked on a few more steps. \"Peter!\" he heard again, this time with an even greater urgency. \"Peter!\"</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, squinted into the blackness of the night. Who was there? He leaned forward, stumbled, and fell to his knees. Reaching out a hand to the ground before him, Peter felt nothing but thin air. A quarry! Sure enough, as he carefully felt around in a semicircle, he discovered that he was on the brink of a limestone pit. One more step and he would have plummeted to his death. One more step--if he hadn't heeded God's voice, his life would have ended. Out there on the desolate moor Someone knew him, and Someone cared.</p><p>God knows our name. We are not some cosmic blur in the universe. God fashioned us. God made us. God created us. We are His. He cares. He loves. He knows us personally. We matter to Him. At times we may feel alone, but He is always there, calling our name, calling us into the security of His arms. Calling us home.</p><p>Ellen White writes, \"Jesus knows us individually, and is touched with the feeling of our infirmities. He knows us all by name. He knows the very house in which we live, the name of each occupant. He has at times given direction to His servants to go to a certain street in a certain city, to such a house, to find one of His sheep\" (<em>The Desire of Ages</em>, p. 479).</p><p>Jesus loves us that much. What troubles us troubles Him. What bothers us bothers Him. What hurts us hurts Him. We are His children. His interests are linked with ours. Nothing that in any way concerns us escapes His notice.

"3","17","Looking Unto Jesus","On Solid Ground","<p><em>Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. </em>Hebrews 12:2.</p><p>Some time ago I received a letter from a mother who had lost two young sons, a 3-year-old boy and a 16-month-old baby boy. Both had drowned in a backyard swimming pool.</p><p>After a difficult period of grief she managed to refocus her vision. She began looking at Jesus intently.</p><p>She realized her life was worth living if God could use her in some way. She surrendered her life into His hands, placing her complete trust in Him. She began to experience an intense desire to get closer to God, to walk with Him each day. She found that this even made her feel closer to her two lost sons.</p><p>She wrote in her letter, \"Now I hunger and thirst after God because of my love for Him. I know what it means to depend on Him fully, to seek Him with my whole heart, to love Him from my innermost being. I know how it feels . . . when God touches your soul and comforts you. I know how it feels to rest my head on His bosom.\"</p><p>This woman looked intently at Jesus in her darkest hour.</p><p>How can we look to Jesus? Seeing Jesus in Scripture brings spiritual vitality to our whole being. In the Gospels, Jesus heals the sick, multiplies the bread, raises the dead, forgives sin, delivers demoniacs, and calms storms. He brings healing, happiness, and hope. He overcomes disaster, demons, and death. He defeats sorrow, suffering, and sickness. He triumphs over sin and Satan. His miracles reveal His power. His parables reveal the teaching of His kingdom. His sermons reveal His eternal principles.</p><p>His life reveals God's love for the spiritually bankrupt. It shows the redeeming quality of His grace. He seeks. He saves. He forgives. He transforms. He changes. He makes hearts new.</p><p>As we look unto Jesus God will fulfill His marvelous promise in 2 Corinthians 3:18: \"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.\" True, lasting character change comes as the Spirit of God impresses upon our minds the life-changing principles we are studying in Scripture. AIt is a law of the mind that it gradually adapts itself to the subjects upon which it is trained to dwell\" (<em>Patriarchs and Prophets</em>, p. 596). As the old hymn states: \"Look upon Jesus, sinless is He, Father, impute His life unto me. My life of scarlet, my sin and woe, cover with His life, whiter than snow.\" Looking unto Jesus, we are changed. Let us look daily to Him, becoming more and more like the lovely Jesus we admire so much.</p>","76"
"3","18","Wired for God","On Solid Ground","<p><em>This people have I formed for myself; they shall declare my praise. </em>Isaiah 43:21.</p><p>In 1975 a Harvard physician named Herbert Benson wrote a best-seller titled <em>The Relaxation Response</em>. He had developed a simple technique to help people reduce stress. He taught them to relax by focusing on some positive mental image. For many people the results were remarkable. They had reduced heart rates, respiration, and stress-related hormones. Dr. Benson was even able to help people who had difficulty sleeping.</p><p>Then Dr. Benson began to notice something especially interesting. A certain subgroup of patients benefited from the \"relaxation response\" more than others. They had even better health, even more rapid recoveries. They were religious people, people who said they felt a sense of closeness to God as they fixed their minds on His goodness. People who meditated about the awesome love and power of God were healthier than those who did not.</p><p>Dr. Benson began to study exactly what was happening to these people when they experienced this closeness to God. Scientists took a new look at the brain's wiring. They observed how different parts of the brain react when stimulated. They pinpointed the headquarters of religious experience in the brain, a small almond-shaped structure called the amygdala.</p><p>Neuroscientist Rhwan Joseph concluded, \"The ability to have religious experiences has a neuroanatomical basis.\" In other words, we have religion in our heads.</p><p>Dr. Benson puts it even more strongly. In his book <em>Timeless Healing</em> he writes, \"Our genetic blueprint has made believing in an Infinite Absolute part of our nature.\" The doctor goes on to say, AWe are wired for God.\" The Bible agrees. The prophet Isaiah exclaims, \"This people I have formed for Myself; they shall declare My praise\" (Isaiah 43:21).</p><p>As our muscles are programmed to exercise, and our hearts designed to function efficiently on a low-fat diet, so our brains are wired to praise God. Our brains are specifically designed for praise. When we praise God the electrical impulses of the brain stimulate the production of positive chemical endorphins. These endorphins are health and life-giving. <em>The Ministry of Healing</em> states, \"Nothing tends more to promote health of body and of soul than does a spirit of gratitude and praise\" (p. 251).</p><p>We are programmed to praise. Today let your heart be filled with the life-giving, health-producing, wellness-stimulating attitude of praise.</p>","77"

When Christians were imprisoned for their faith, God's love still triumphed.</p><p>In 1983 the Soviet Union charged 27-year-old Valentina with transporting Christian literature. The young believer with a charming smile and a strong faith found herself in a work camp in Siberia. The camp was known as the \"Valley of Death\" because of its high mortality rate. Its prisoners felt completely isolated from the rest of the world. It was a place designed to crush the human spirit.</p><p>But Valentina discovered that God was bigger than the gulag. She found a Christian sister, Natasha. In the middle of the night the two young women would sneak out of their barracks and meet under the open heavens. They had moments of beautiful fellowship.</p><p>The temperature was often 40 below zero, and their work boots couldn't keep their feet from freezing. But their hearts were warm.</p><p>\"We would sing and pray for a few minutes, go back to our separate barracks to warm up a little, then meet outside again,\" Valentina remembers. \"Sometimes we stood silently, just gazing together toward heaven. Nothing was dearer to us than heaven.\"</p><p>During her five years of imprisonment Valentina didn't feel abandoned by God. She felt Him come very close. Many times when someone sent her a letter with a quotation from Scripture, the verses seemed to answer a very specific question or need. It seemed as though God the Father was communicating directly with her.</p><p>When she was released in 1987, Valentina summed up her experience with these words from Romans 8:35-37: \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . . . Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.\"</p><p>Valentina wasn't just a survivor. She was more than a conqueror. She experienced God's love in prison.

As the fire raged out of control the firefighters were concerned that someone might still be in the apartment building, although the only ones who used it were vagrants, drug addicts, alcoholics, and prostitutes. Nevertheless, Clancy and his colleagues decided to enter the inferno to conduct a search and rescue operation. Smoke reduced visibility to almost zero.</p><p>Suddenly the second-floor ceiling collapsed, trapping Clancy. His colleagues worked feverishly to deliver him, but when they finally pulled him out, it was too late. His body was burned beyond recognition. The last day of 1995 was the last day of this courageous firefighter's life. He left behind a wife who was six months pregnant and the future they were planning together.</p><p>John Clancy believed that all life was valuable, and was willing to risk his own to save whoever might be in the building. He left the safety of his own home for the danger of a raging fire. He entered the flames to save lives and lost his own. His devotion to duty cost him his life. He could not stand idly by when he knew others were dying.</p><p>Investigators discovered that the fire had been deliberately set. Edwin Smith, one of the \"down and outers\" who was reportedly in the building, set the fire. John Clancy was attempting to save the one who burned the building down. He gave his life for an arsonist.</p><p>Two thousand years ago another walked into the fires of death itself to save us. He delivered us from the blazing inferno of hell's fires. When Christ died, He voluntarily took death's curse upon Himself. Today's text declares, \"For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\" Jesus never sinned, but He became sin for us. He voluntarily took upon Himself all of the shame and guilt for our sins.</p><p>He died the death we deserved so we could live the life He deserved. When Jesus suffered the excruciating death of the cross, He felt the separation from His Father. In the words \"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?\" (Matthew 27:46) Jesus expresses His sense of utter lostness. He could not see through the doors of the tomb. Sin shut out the Father's face. Our Savior experienced the death that sinners will die.</p><p>Jesus' love went the distance. He experienced the agonies of hell itself to save us. In the light of such love all we can do is fall at His feet and worship Him forever. He is worthy of our highest praise.</p>","79"
"3","21","In the Storms of Life","On Solid Ground","<p><em>Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</em> Hebrews 2:17.</p><p>A storm brewed just ahead of the English steamboat Ariel. The crew urged all passengers to safety below decks. But one passenger approached the captain with an odd request. He wanted to be lashed to a mast on the deck.</p><p>The captain stared in surprise at this small man with a weathered face. At length, crew members did as the man asked.</p><p>The steamboat sailed into the teeth of the storm. For four hours the wind drove waves furiously around the boat. And the passenger stood there paralyzed, helpless. He had known he would be terribly frightened. He knew he wouldn't be able to stay above deck if given a choice.</p><p>But he wanted, as he said later, to really see the storm. To feel the storm, to have the storm blow itself into him until he became a part of it. That's why he had himself bound to a mast.</p><p>After this experience, the passenger, Joseph Mallord William Turner, went back to his studio and painted a remarkable picture that captured the awesome energy of the elements. It became one of the great artist's masterpieces.</p><p>Only after the artist experienced the storm could he fully understand its fury. He painted a masterpiece because he personally felt the fierceness of the wind, the pelting of the rain, the rocking of the boat, the salt spray of the waves, and the horrendous claps of thunder in the darkness of the night. Before Jesus could fully redeem us, He needed to experience what we experience in order to be our perfect Savior. He too needed to experience the fury of the storm. He needed to experience all of life's challenges. He needed to be wrenched with all of life's anguish and torn apart with all of life's heartbreak. If you are feeling lonely, Jesus understands, for He felt lonely too when His people rejected Him.</p><p>Has someone betrayed you? Do you feel hurt? Jesus felt hurt when one of His best friends betrayed Him. Is your body wracked with pain? His was as He hung on the cross. Do you face temptations that just seem to overpower you? Jesus experienced Satan's fiercest temptations. He understands. Through it all He was faithful. We can come to Him with all of our sorrows, disappointments, pain, and temptation. He will strengthen us to triumph just as He did. We have a sympathizing Savior who understands us and who is there to give us daily strength to meet life's greatest challenges.</p>","80"

Four teams of hijackers commandeered four separate airplanes and used them as instruments of death. An American Airlines jet streaked across the New York skyline and slammed into one of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Minutes later another hijacked jet, a United Airlines flight, hurtled into the second tower. Another plane dove into the Pentagon, while a fourth crashed in a remote area near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p><p>One image indelibly impressed upon my mind is a group of weary firefighters emerging from the smoke of the World Trade Center, covered with soot. They are carrying a frail old man away from the wreckage. The headline in huge red letters reads \"Saving Grace.\" The caption: \"Facing mortal danger, they risked their lives to save others.\"</p><p>That picture speaks to my heart. Those who were frail and weak could never have gotten out of the burning building alone. They needed a deliverer. They needed someone willing to risk life and limb. They needed a Savior. Without someone who cared, someone willing to plunge into the flames, someone willing to die if necessary, the trapped had no hope.</p><p>We too are condemned to the flames. \"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\" (Romans 3:23) and \"The wages of sin is death\" (Romans 6:23).</p><p>We cannot save ourselves. The incredibly \"good news\" of the gospel is simply this--Jesus leaped into the flames. He took on hell itself. On the cross He took upon Himself all of the condemnation of sin. My sin. Your sin. Jesus experienced all of the anguish that sinners will ultimately experience. \"He tasted death for everyone\" (Hebrews 2:9). What a Savior! What a Deliverer! What a Redeemer!</p><p>In my imagination I see eternity's newspaper on our first day in Heaven. Emblazoned across the front page is a huge picture of Jesus with blood-stained hands and a bruised brow, carrying me in His arms. When you see the picture He is carrying you. The crimson headline reads \"Saving Grace,\" and the entire host of the redeemed fall on their knees in praise. \"Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honor and glory and blessing!\" (Revelation 5:12).</p><p>Forever and ever and ever. Amen.</p>","81"
"3","23","Delivered","On Solid Ground","<p><em>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</em> Philippians 4:13.</p><p>Anna was caught in the stranglehold of an intense struggle. Her modest apartment was located in the center of Honolulu's drug district. I met Anna while conducting a series of lectures on Bible prophecy in Hawaii. She seemed powerless to resist the drug dealers who daily urged her to buy another joint. Frequently she gave in, indulging her growing habit.</p><p>At the conclusion of one of my evangelistic meetings she pleaded with me for help. \"Pastor, I'm so weak! I seem powerless to resist!\"</p><p>I pointed her to God's promise: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\" (Philippians 4:13), and Anna made a marvelous discovery. A new sparkle flashed in her eyes. Jesus really would help her! He would actually supply His power to deliver her. Two of my associates visited Anna almost daily. The word went out in that drug-infested neighborhood: \"Leave Anna alone! She's going straight.\"</p><p>Anna's discovery can make a powerful difference in your life, too!</p><p>The Christian life is not an initial commitment to Christ and then failure. It is not endless struggle against temptation on our own. Our Lord does not save us, then leave us helpless to battle with the devil. The Christ who redeems us from sin's condemnation delivers us from sin's power. The Savior who died to forgive us lives to empower us. We do not save ourselves; God saves us. We cannot deliver ourselves; Christ delivers us. \"Many have an idea that they must do some part of the work alone. They have trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sin, but now they seek by their own efforts to live aright. But every such effort must fail. Jesus says, 'Without Me ye can do nothing.' Our growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness--all depend upon our union with Christ\" (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 69).</p><p>Battling alone, we are powerless. The enemy is much too strong. His temptations are overpowering. The living Christ offers to do for us what we could never do for ourselves. He offers us His power, His strength. As we open our hearts to Him He will deliver us from the chains of sin that bind us. In Christ, through Christ, by Christ, with Christ, we are truly set free. He is our almighty Deliverer.</p>","82"
"3","24","I Owe You My Life","On Solid Ground","<p><em>I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me.</em> Galatians 2:20.</p><p>Stanley Praimnath sat at his desk on the eighty-first floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Suddenly the nose of a 767 jet filled the sky outside his window. He dropped the phone and dove under his desk. Steel shrieked against steel as the ceiling crashed down. Electrical wires sparked. Desks and filing cabinets hurtled across the room. Smoke poured in. Stanley started sobbing and then praying.</p><p>People fled the building by the thousands. Horribly burned and profusely bleeding, they stumbled down darkened staircases.</p><p>Brian Clark was running down from the eighty-fourth floor when he heard cries for help. It was Stanley, who had somehow managed to crawl through the rubble but was now trapped under a fallen wall.</p><p>Brian pulled away charred debris and shattered doors. Finally he reached the desperate man. \"You have got to make it through the wall,\" he yelled. \"I can't,\" Stanley replied. \"You have to do this,\" Brian shouted back. Stanley clawed his way until he was partly free, and Brian pulled him from the rubble. The two strangers hugged like brothers. When they finally got outside, with tears in his eyes Stan looked at Brian and said, \"Keep in touch, because I owe you my life.\"</p><p>When I think of the amazing love that saved me my heart too cries out, \"Lord, I want to keep in touch, because I owe You my life.\" The essence of the Christian life is fellowship with God. When two people are in love, they long to be together. Separation is painful. When we fully sense Jesus' love and commitment in saving us, our hearts respond in love. We long to be with Him. We want to spend time with Him in fellowship. We don't want to be separated from His love for an instant. \"The price paid for our redemption, the infinite sacrifice of our heavenly Father in giving His Son to die for us, should give us exalted conceptions of what we may become through Christ. . . . 'Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God,' 1 John 3:1. What a value this places upon man\" (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 15).</p><p>God values us highly. He loves us immensely. He longs to be with us intensely. His love breaks our hard hearts and draws us to Him. Through Calvary we owe Him our lives. The least we can do is to give back to Him the lives He redeemed and gave to us.</p>","83"
"3","25","Counting the Cost","On Solid Ground","<p><em>But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. </em>Philippians 3:7.</p><p>No one can take from you what you have already given away. Paul consciously chose to give everything he possessed to Christ. Nothing was worth more to him than Christ. Nothing was more valuable than Christ's love or more precious than His grace. In comparison to His relationship with Christ, everything else paled into insignificance. When the apostle exclaims, \"What things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ,\" the word Aloss\" in the original language means \"dung,\" \"refuse,\" or \"garbage.\" Christ is so incredibly precious that all of this world's treasures are garbage in comparison.</p><p>On December 8, 1934, Chinese bandits murdered two Presbyterian missionaries, John and Betty Stam. The thieves burned their home to the ground. Some days after the tragedy, Christian friends found Mrs. Stam's Bible among the charred ruins. On the flyleaf she had written, \"Lord, I give up my purpose and plans, all my desires, hopes and ambitions, and accept Thy will for my life. I give myself, my life, my all utterly to Thee to be Thine forever. I hand over to Thy keeping all my friendships, my love. All the people whom I love are to take second place in my heart. Fill me and seal me with thy Holy Spirit. Work out Thy whole life in my life at any cost now and forever. For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.\"
Christ fills the empty heart. Christ enriches the poverty-stricken soul. Christ replaces the dung of this world with the priceless, matchless charms of His love.</p><p>Ellen White states it succinctly, \"Whatever shall draw away the heart from God must be given up\" (<em>Steps to Christ</em>, p. 44). The basic question in the Christian life is \"Who has your heart?\"</p><p>Jesus' teachings contain some amazing paradoxes. One incredible paradox is simply this: \"By giving all, we receive all.\" Today Christ offers us His all. His grace. His pardon. His mercy. His power. His courage. His comfort. His hope. His promise of eternity. The fellowship of His presence now and forever. In light of all He gives us, everything we give away is only garbage. What an exchange!</p>","84"
"3","26","God Empowers Our Choices","On Solid Ground","<p><em>And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve. . . But as for me and my house we will serve the Lord. </em>Joshua 24:15.</p><p>My friend Bill's father struggled with tobacco. Early in the morning Bill would see his dad pacing in front of the family farmhouse, fighting a terrible craving to chew tobacco. Often the old man took his chewing tobacco in his hand and threw it far out into the cornfield. Now he was free. He was done chewing tobacco.</p><p>But, as Bill tells the story, along about noon he would see his dad out among the cornstalks, head bent low, looking for something. What was he searching for? The tobacco he had thrown out in the morning!</p><p>Here's my question. If you were God, would you let him find it? \"Oh no!\" somebody says. \"God would not let him find it!\" But God did. Why? Because He gave Bill's dad the same power of choice in the afternoon that He did in the morning. God does not manipulate the will. God allows us to make choices. When we choose to put our will on the side of right, the Holy Spirit empowers our choices.</p><p>We do not overcome Satan's temptations through our willpower. We overcome them through God's power. Here is an often neglected, greatly misunderstood truth. We cannot overcome sin in our lives without God. And God will not overcome sin in our lives without us. In the plan of salvation our cooperation with God is imperative. As the Holy Spirit impresses our minds, we choose to surrender that specific sin that is offensive to God. Then the Holy Spirit gives us the strength to overcome. We do not overcome sin through our determined choice. Jesus made it plain when He said, \"For without Me you can do nothing\" (John 15:5).</p><p>Let's suppose I am in a large auditorium. The room is totally dark. It's impossible to find the exit. What if I had a shovel? How long would it take to shovel the darkness out? How much effort would it take to shovel all the darkness out? What if 100 people worked for three hours--could we push it out together? What if you guided my hand to a light switch on the wall? What if you helped me throw the switch? Immediately the room would fill with light. Why? The action of my finger, however small, threw the switch and connected the electrical wires with the source of power. When we place our will on the side of right, we connect with a source of infinite power. God's power flows into our lives. Dramatic, miraculous change occurs.</p><p>Christ longs to fill your life with His power. He longs to empower your choices. He will do it today. Why not yield to the impression of His Spirit now? </p>","85"
"3","27","Priceless Treasure","On Solid Ground","<p><em>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</em> Matthew 13:44.</p><p>Colorado has a rich history of silver and gold mining. One of the most successful Colorado mining operators in the days of the early West was a man named Horace Tabor. He made millions from a site near Cripple Creek that he named Matchless Mine.</p><p>His wealth went to his head, and he began to do as he pleased. Tabor divorced his wife and married a beautiful socialite named Baby Doe. Soon misfortune overtook them. The price of gold and silver plummeted. Tabor incurred enormous debts. In the end he died a brokenhearted, poor man. But before his death he supposedly gave Baby Doe this admonition: \"Have faith in the Matchless Mine; never give it up. It will give you back all that I have lost.\"</p><p>Despite this, the Matchless was soon lost to foreclosure; but for whatever reason, Baby Doe decided to live in a dilapidated storage shack near it, and continued there (at the generosity of the mine's new owners) until her death in 1935. The Matchless proved to have played out; if Baby Doe was hoping against hope that it would yet yield riches, her hopes were never realized.</p><p>One mine will never play out. There is one source of wealth that produces more and more. There is a mine of truth that is endless. The riches of His grace can never be exhausted. Jesus is the treasure hidden in the field. In comparison to all we have, our Savior is more precious still.</p><p>Someone has defined sacrifice as giving up something of lesser value for something of greater value. For example, when a person gives up smoking, they give up something of lesser value, cigarettes, which contribute to cancer and heart disease, for something of higher value, good health. Jesus' love is of inestimable value. His grace is incomparable. Receiving Jesus, we receive peace and pardon and power and purpose. Think of it. In Christ we receive an inner peace as He enters our life. He gives us a sense of calm security. He delivers us from the guilt of our past failures. He silences the accusing voices of a condemning conscience. In Christ we receive power. He imparts supernatural power to live. He is stronger than the habits that bind us. </p><p>The power of grace is greater than the power of sin. In Christ we have a new purpose for living. Christ gives us a new direction for our lives. He gives to life a new sense of meaning. There is no greater treasure. There is nothing of any greater value. There is nothing more precious. Christ is a mine that will never ever run out.</p>","86"

The inward man is being renewed day by day.</em> 2 Corinthians 4:16.</p><p><em>We do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. </em>2 Corinthians 4:18.</p><p>The apostle Paul was absorbed with Christ. In these passages he eloquently proclaims three \"nots.\" In the first \"not,\" the apostle declares that \"We are not sufficient.\"</p><p>The word \"sufficient,\" as defined by <em>Webster's New American Dictionary</em>, means \"adequate to accomplish a purpose or meet a need.\" It can also be defined as \"capable of\" or \"able to do.\" Christ is the only one who can meet our deepest needs. Any attempt to meet the inmost needs of the soul outside of Christ is destined for bitter failure. Pleasure cannot satisfy our soul hunger. Popularity can't do it. Prestige can't accomplish it. Power won't meet the heart's needs. Only Jesus can truly satisfy. He is our sufficiency. Neither are we sufficient to save ourselves or fight the battle with our adversary alone. As the apostle states, \"Our sufficiency is from God\" (2 Corinthians 3:5). Christ is our sufficiency. He is also our source of confidence.</p><p>In Paul's second \"not,\" he exclaims that we do not lose heart. Our outward person may perish. Sickness may afflict us. Disease may ravage our frame. Old age may take its toll. Heart disease, cancer, or diabetes may devastate our body. In spite of what happens to us, Christ is working within us. He is our courage. He is our confidence. He is our comforter. He gives us hope for a brighter tomorrow. We do not lose heart. Christ lifts our spirits.</p><p>The apostle now comes to his final and third \"not.\" \"We do not look at the things which are seen.\" Christ is our vision. He lifts our sight from what is around us to what is above us. He lifts our vision from what is to what will be. He lifts our eyes from the things of time to the things of eternity.</p><p>During the London bombings of World War II, enemy planes pounded the city night after night. Fires blazed as whole neighborhoods turned into rubble. One little boy, peering out from a shelter, kept staring at the explosions in the distance. He stood there shaking and crying. But his father came quickly and turned his boy around and said firmly, \"Face toward me. Face toward me.\"</p><p>The rest of the night, while bombs streamed down, the little boy would turn his face toward his father and stop shaking; the terror would drain from his face.</p><p>Today and each day Jesus appeals to us: \"Face toward Me. Fix your eyes upon Me. Look at Me. I am your sufficiency. I am your confidence. I am your vision. Rest in My arms. Be secure in My love. Be hopeful in My embrace.\"</p>","87"

Studying Scripture in his Belgian home, he was overwhelmed with God's love. He concluded that salvation was through faith in Christ alone. Christ filled his heart and radiated from his countenance, and he just could not keep silent. The Christ whom he so passionately loved led him to share that love with others.</p><p>Church and state were united in sixteenth-century Europe, and the state church did not tolerate the slightest dissent. Claes was arrested and brought to Ghent because he challenged the church's view on salvation. The authorities tried to talk him out of his beliefs before burning him alive. He knew the only way he could avoid the stake was to give up those beliefs. But he held fast. Claes wasn't intimidated by the power of the state looming over him. He couldn't be coerced. </p><p>Claes was asked, \"What is your faith?\" He replied, \"I believe only in Christ Jesus, that He is the living and true Son of God, and that there is no other salvation, whither in heaven or on earth.\" Claes kept his eyes on the Lamb of God, who had shed His blood for him. That was his security and strength. That was his purpose. He took great comfort in the promise Jesus made in Matthew: \"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\" (Matthew 28:20, KJV).</p><p>Jesus came through in Claes's darkest hour. And Claes could have joy in the Lord his God. In the last moments of his life, just before his execution, our Lord gave him an unusual peace. Claes wrote, \"My heart kindled within me with joy to the Lord my God, so that all my trouble and anxiety were driven from me as dust is swept from the street.\"</p><p>Claes went to his death secure in Jesus' love. He was at perfect peace.</p><p>All the demons in hell cannot separate us from God's love. Sickness cannot do it. Tragedy can't accomplish it. Misfortune and mistakes are not powerful enough to separate us from God's love. Divorce, disease, discouragement, disaster, and death itself are not strong enough to separate us from God's love. In our darkest moments God's love is still there. Like Claes, you too can exclaim, \"Lord, Thou art faithful to Thy promise.\"</p>","88"

She was arrested for her faith in 1559 and separated from her family, including her husband, Claes. When authorities executed Claes, Soetgen tasted fear and loneliness. From her prison cell in Ghent, Belgium, she looked out at life going by and knew she would never be a part of it again. She sensed that she would never again see her children. With tears in her eyes she wrote a letter of calm assurance and encouragement to them. This letter has been preserved down through the centuries, and it calls us to faithfulness today.</p><p>She wrote, \"Since it pleases the Lord to take me out of this world, I will leave you a memorial, not of silver or of gold, for such jewels are perishable, but I should like to write a jewel into your heart, if it were possible, which is the word of truth.\"</p><p>In her final hours Soetgen did not think of her suffering and imminent death. She longed for her children to be faithful to the Christ she loved. She longed for them to experience His grace, to be faithful to His truth. Her letter continues with these powerful words: AI commend you to the Lord. . . . May He keep you to the end of your lives. May He lead you to the New Jerusalem, that we may see each other with joy on the day of the resurrection.\"</p><p>Helpless could have overwhelmed Soetgen. She could have just fallen apart. Instead she wrote a letter full of love and confidence.</p><p>Just before her death, Soetgen received an encouraging letter from her daughter, Betgen. Yes, her precious little girl still clung to Christ. Yes, the same faith still burned in her heart. Yes, the same love for Christ still filled her life.</p><p>On November 27, 1560, Soetgen burned as a so-called heretic. Her parting words to her children, hastily written with a trembling hand, were \"Herewith I commend you to the Lord, and to the work of His grace.\"</p><p>There is nothing more precious than our relationship with Christ. There is no other relationship more important. To know Him is life's most important priority. Echoing and reechoing over the centuries from a damp Belgian cell, the witness of a faithful martyr's life urges us to Aseek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness\" (Matthew 6:33).</p>","89"

Sometimes he would sail down the canals of Amsterdam with fellow believers--so they could worship in secret.</p><p>When Pieter and his wife had their first child, the couple tried to keep the infant hidden so they wouldn't be forced to have it christened in the state church. But neighbors eventually betrayed them to the magistrates.</p><p>Pieter was tried, convicted for Acrimes against the divine and secular majesty . . . which disturb the peace,\" and condemned Ato be executed with fire . . . and his entire property confiscated.\"</p><p>They put this earnest ferry operator on the rack in one last fiendish effort to bend his faith. But it proved unshakable. Pieter was burned in January of 1569.</p><p>A close friend of his, Willem Janss, heard about the planned execution and hurried to the site from a nearby town. Wanting to offer some encouragement, he arrived at Amsterdam's gate, but the bar had already been let down. Willem had to bribe the gatekeeper to let him in.</p><p>He rushed to the site of the execution and arrived just as Pieter was being led out to the stake. Willem called out, \"Contend valiantly, dear brother.\"</p><p>What gave Pieter such death-defying faith? Why was he willing to stand \"heartily\" for the Lord without wavering? There is one significant reason. He believed that Jesus was more than a good man. He believed that Jesus was divine and that His offer of eternal life was real. To reject Jesus was to reject eternal life. Pieter accepted the Savior's words to Martha: \"I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die\" (John 11:25, 26). Eternal life is life forever in the joyful presence of God the Father, Jesus Christ His Son, the Holy Spirit and all the heavenly hosts.</p><p>The martyrs of the past saw beyond the flames to eternity. By faith they grasped the promises of God.</p><p>The promise is ours today: \"He who believes in Me shall never die\" (John 11:25, 26). Our lives are \"hidden with Christ in God\" (Colossians 3:3). His promise of the resurrection is certain. We can have absolute confidence that He will fulfill His word.</p>","90"

She is absolutely perfect! Ayiana resembles her mother, Natalie, and has her cute nose. She is a pink little thing, with coal-black hair that has a bit of wave in it.</p><p>I sat and watched Ayiana after the nurse came in the room to weigh her and check her temperature. Standard procedure. After she dressed her in a fresh gown and diaper, carefully swaddled and returned her to the tall bassinet, Ayiana finally opened her eyes. I stared as she seemed to be familiarizing herself with the world around. They say that newborn infants can't visually focus right away, but it looked as if she was trying out those strangely blue/brown/black eyes in earnest. Her pretty pink mouth opened as wide as she could get it, obviously searching for her mommy's breast. It was too, too cute. I didn't want to take my eyes off that precious face.</p><p>Later, I thought about the differences between a human baby and a newborn in almost any part of the animal kingdom. By the end of the day of its birth, a new giraffe has already learned to stand up. The baby bald eagle will eat its meaty meal with ease on that first day. But Ayiana will not stand up unassisted until she's somewhere between 6 and 9 months. She may enjoy her first unstrained or unmashed meal within that same period. Simply, Ayiana needs her mother, not just to survive but to get from place to place, to make decisions for her, and to provide security.</p><p>Watching our little goddaughter reminded me of how dependent I am on my heavenly Papa for survival--not just physically, but spiritually. I am as pitiful and as needy as a newborn babe when I set out to make it on my own. I am not equipped. I need a tender, loving, and doting Daddy.</p><p>How blessed we are to live in a world created by an awesome, eternal God who wants so much to be our Abba-Father as well. Such love, such condescension!</p><p><em>Thank You, Papa-God, for creating me, then adopting me, and providing everything I need to survive.

Recently I returned from a trip to Seoul, South Korea. It was truly a different world from the United States in more than one way, but there was one thing that stood out above all the rest--the people.</p><p>My flight over stopped in Tokyo before going on to Shanghai, so there were mostly Asian passengers on board. I was really impressed with how quiet and calm everyone was for 13 long hours. They are truly to be commended for their respectful decorum.</p><p>On the streets of Seoul, or in subway stations, you have only to pause with a questioning look to draw someone to your side offering assistance. It seems to be their goal in life to be helpful. Riding on the subways and buses, even middle-aged women will give up their seats to someone older, handicapped, pregnant, or carrying a child. And I loved their habit of bowing to you as you go in and out of places of business. Their politeness is inspiring.</p><p>The most lasting impression, though, was the women--meek and mild are the words that come to mind. And they have beautiful smiles. Their modest clothing seemed to be in sharp contrast to that in other parts of the world where women are taken in by fashions that leave much to be desired. Sometimes we don't see ourselves as we are until compared with those who are different. In 1Timothy 2:9 and 10 Paul admonishes those who claim godliness to dress properly.</p><p>Whether it's respect, humility, politeness, or modesty, if we try to be just a little better than the culture around us we'll go downhill with it because it's getting worse with the passing of time. We should be a transforming example. My Korean trip was a wake-up call for me to live up to God's ideals--not the world's.</p><p><em>Lord, please help us renew our minds so we can be transformed to follow Your will instead of our own.</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Donna Meyer Voth</div></p>","94"

So sure it needed a battery, I purchased one, and charged the new battery according to the instructions. When I rechecked the phone, I could see that there was some power as the messages and caller ID were intact, but I still couldn't get a dial tone.</p><p>I thought that maybe this phone had seen its best days and relegated it to the trash and purchased a new one. The next day, while programming the new phone, I read this advice from the instructions sheet: \"Once per month use a pencil eraser and clean the connections to maintain uninterrupted use.\" I retrieved my discarded phone from the trash and plugged it in again. I cleaned the connection points as outlined, and the phone quickly gave me a dial tone. Connection points accumulate corrosion that gets in the way of direct connections.</p><p>Sometimes our very lives get so corroded with the sins of anger, greed, guilt, envy, and jealousy that we can't get a direct connection with the Lord. The extra prayer is the eraser that removes the corrosion and allows connection with the Lord.</p><p>Sometimes as God's children we are seeking directions from the Lord as to what He wants us to do, but often we don't wait to get full instructions.

If we aren't careful, even the very elect will be deceived, thinking we are connected with the Lord.</p><p>During the final days of this earth the evil one will try many things to deceive us. The devil knows his future and desires to keep us misconnected from Christ.

We had one daughter and two sons, and he just couldn't understand why I wanted another baby so badly.</p><p>I had been an only child for 11 years and had always wanted lots of children so no child would have to be alone. When the doctor told me I could have no more children, I was devastated, but I knew there was another way to have children, and that was adoption.</p><p>I am a firm believer in prayer, so I prayed that God would change my husband's heart and help him to also want to adopt a little girl. I was sure that would be in God's plan, but year after year went by, and still my husband was opposed to the idea.</p><p>Then one morning, when our son youngest was 9, my husband walked into the bedroom where I was making the bed and calmly informed me that he had been thinking about it and had decided that it was probably a good idea for us to adopt a little girl. Almost without giving it another thought, I replied, \"But honey, now it would be like raising her all alone; I think we should adopt twins.\" As he rolled his eyes, I knew that even though he was going to sputter, my prayers had been answered--times two. It was all in God's perfect timing.</p><p>Our physician, who was on the board of a well-known adoption agency, was a big help to us. At first there were no twins available, but when the time was right, the agency placed identical twin girls with us.</p><p> For nine years I had questioned why God was not answering my prayers for a baby girl, but I just thank Him every day that He saw fit to have me wait until the perfect time for the perfect little girls to become a part of our family. For 36 years they have been such a wonderful part of our lives, and we have no doubt that they were God's gift to us.</p><p>Nine years seemed like a long time to wait for an answer, but it was perfect timing, and God answered our prayers at just the right time.

How could I carry them all to school at the same time? Which one to leave? Which had priority? They all did, I assured myself. Why not leave some bags in the car and make a second trip? Too much trouble, I reasoned. I was determined to totter the two city blocks to the entrance of the school with my six packages.</p><p>Before I had gone 20 steps, I felt shooting pains in my abdominal region. That's when I realized that my hands were not alone in carrying my burden--internal organs were hurting as well. After one block I put everything down. I considered leaving the low priority items--two hefty reams of paper--near a tree and return for them later. Then I stubbornly decided against the idea.</p><p>Then I heard footsteps behind me, and, glancing over my shoulder, I saw a tall young man with a tall backpack. Although I didn't recognize him, I immediately asked, \"Would you like to help your teacher?\" Without hesitating, he grabbed the heaviest of my bags. What a relief!</p><p>Thanks so much,\" I whispered. </p><p>As we walked toward the school I told him how happy I was that he had arrived at the right time to assist me. Silently, I wondered, <em>Why did he appear out of nowhere at the moment when I felt that I couldn't take another step?</em> As the young man placed my bags at the door of the school, I told him, \"God sent you to help me today; do you know that?\"</p><p>As I divided the bags, preparing for two trips to my third floor classroom, the importance of the incident began to sink in. I thought of the heavy burdens I had been carrying all week. Stubbornly, I had been struggling with them, praying about them, but not handing them entirely over to God. Now I thanked my heavenly Father for presenting an object lesson to me so vividly. Our God is just waiting for us to lay down our burdens so that He can carry them for us.</p><p>Today, place your burdens--large and small--at His feet.

Her brothers acknowledge her as the mover and shaker in the family. It is because of her, they insist, that they and their children are where they are today--geographically and professionally. </p><p>Almost a year before her seventieth birthday, people started wondering how they could celebrate the milestone moment of the person they loved so well. Eventually, the notion of a spectacular party took root. \"She deserves something wonderful,\" someone said. All agreed.</p><p> And so it began. Work started on the invitations. She had not had a formal wedding when she got married more than 20 years before, but she always knew what she would have chosen. The embossed, rose-framed cards seemed perfect. Then there was the guest list. She came from a large, close-knit family scattered all over the globe--all had to be invited. </p><p>Next, arrangements were made for the banquet hall, the menu, and the program, and scores of minutiae in between. The last thing on her list was the gown. She had to find the perfect dress. She saw it, one day, in a bridal shop--a lovely, violet, sequined creation. </p><p>Opening my Bible one morning I read again the poignant verses in Matthew 22: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet\" (verse 1, NIV). I smiled as I saw how closely the party checklist mirrored Matthew's--invitation, guests, food, clothes, and all. Spiritual similarities spilled over in my mind. Slipping the invitation in my beaded bag, just in case the maître d' had questions about my presence, I praised God for His guest list. He has invited me.</p><p>My friend was radiant as she greeted each perfectly attired guest. Nobody had dared to come unprepared. I prayed that we would all be as prepared for Him. </p><p>This party was only a foretaste of our heavenly party. Unlike what my friend's relatives affirmed, we will know that we do not deserve anything so wonderful. As we don those glory-bright robes, we will know that we are welcomed in that celestial banquet hall only because our Savior Redeemer chose to wear ragged, sin-splattered clothes in our stead.

And we all can be saved in this same way, by coming to Christ, no matter who we are or what we have been like.</em> Romans 3:21, 22, TLB.</p><p>Things were really going great!

None! As the list goes on, so does our pride in our own self-righteousness. However, a closer look reveals that our \"righteousness is like dirty rags,\" as described in Isaiah 64:6.

Our daughter, Karimah, mother of two very young children, returned to school. We supported her decision even though it meant moving her family to England. Her husband, Michael, also supported her by aborting his career to make the move. We knew there were challenging times ahead. To help her, my husband and I tapped into our retirement savings. This was an investment we willingly made to help our daughter realize her dreams.</p<<p>The challenges began when she started experiencing some unforeseeable difficulties. Her prearranged accommodation did not work, and when the children joined her the landlord gave her one week to find alternate accommodations. This was difficult on a limited budget in a very expensive city. Worst of all, shortly after her third move she discovered their passports were missing. Her passport contained the coveted five-year visa. Her husband's ability to work was incumbent on proof of the visa.</p><p>At first there was no panic, just concern. Three weeks of almost nonstop searching did not turn up the missing passports. Then sheer panic set in on both sides of the Atlantic. Thoughts of my daughter and granddaughters in a foreign country with no travel documents stirred in me a level of anxiety I had not experienced for a long time. I was praying also that Michael would receive a job offer before leaving Canada. That didn't happen. I prayed that Karimah would receive educational funding. That didn't happen. Most urgently, I prayed for the return of the missing documents. That didn't happen. </p><p>What did happen was that while the adults were anxious, 3-year-old Naomi was thanking God for providing a \"beautiful\" home for them. Two-year-old Asha frequently invited us to \"come see my 'blue' house.\" We subsequently found out that only the front door is blue and structurally the building is less than beautiful. Obviously it's all about perspective. The documents are presently being replaced. Our son-in-law found temporary work in his field.

One afternoon while my husband was at work, I decided to change the shower head myself to one that \"massages.\" I found it in a box of supplies, then hunted until I found the pipe wrenches. The one I picked out seemed heavy, but I figured bigger was better for my plumbing job. 
 I climbed into the bathtub to take off the shower head. It wouldn't budge with my fingers, so I fit the pipe wrench on it and pulled hard. Nothing. More strength was obviously needed.  Again I fit the pipe wrench on the shower head, climbed onto the edge of the bathtub, then leaped off, putting all my weight on the wrench. There was an ominous snap and a clang as something fell behind the wall of the shower.</p><p>Sick with terror, I pondered the situation. A sudden ring of the phone interrupted my thoughts. My mother cheerfully announced that she and Dad would be arriving the next day for a visit. I rushed down the street for some advice from my friend, whose father was a builder. When she called him, he said, \"You'll have to rip the bathtub out and get behind the wall, because you've snapped a water line. Don't use the tub or shower until it's fixed.\" </p><p>Now I was really ill! My husband returned home late that night. His face was grim as we tried to think how we could possibly get the shower fixed before my parents arrived. It was time to bring in the heavy ammunition. Kneeling on the floor beside our bed, we gave the problem to the Lord, begging Him to help us. Then I crawled into bed and fell asleep. But He woke me early with this thought: <em>The wall behind the mirror in the master bathroom is shared with the other bathroom. Take the mirror off, cut a hole in the wall, and you can fix the pipe.</em> What relief! I got up quietly and wrote it all down. </p><p>When my husband woke up, I excitedly told him what our Lord had told me, and He was exactly right! We took the mirror off and cut a big hole through which we could see the copper pipe. We bought copper pipe and soldering supplies, and by the time my parents arrived the pipe was fixed, the \"shower massage\" head was on, and the lovely big mirror covered the hole.</p><p><em>Thank You, Lord, for still speaking to us today and hearing and answering our prayers.</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Cheryl Hurt</div></p>","102"

He failed to be convinced, and our different opinions became a private little joke.</p><p>By nature, I'm an early riser. I cherish the early morning hours when my concentration is best. I love talking with my Best Friend and listening to His words to me from His Book. It sets the tone for my day. For several months, though, I had been having problems with focusing. I was definitely troubled with eyestrain. I looked forward to my routine visit with my ophthalmologist.

His suit was blue! He had been right all along and had been so gracious about it.</p><p>This experience taught me a lesson I never want to forget.

She had a strong personality and a big smile. I also remember her energy to serve Christ and study His word. But what I remember most about Madeline were her comments regarding tomatoes and parking spaces. At a Bible study I attended at the time, several of us were having a discussion on faith. Some of the attendees gave examples of how they exercised their faith. I found Madelaine's method very interesting. </p><p>She stated that she had learned to pray over everything, even things that would seem insignificant to most people. She described being at a grocery store and trying to select the best food for her family. For example, before she picked out the tomatoes to purchase, she would pray over them. She did this with all her grocery shopping, asking for God's guidance to make the best choice. At the time it was hard to fathom doing this over produce, but I realized the issue at hand was bigger than the tomatoes themselves. </p><p>Madelaine went on to say that she also prayed to find parking spaces. As she entered a parking lot, she would pray to find the spot the Lord wanted her to have. Upon hearing this, I could feel my left eye brow arching, and I was beginning to look like Sherlock Holmes. Nevertheless, I found what she said interesting and insightful. I yearned for that kind of faith and trust.</p><p>Since then, when I am in the produce section of a grocery store, I seem to always think of Madelaine and the lesson that God showed me through her. How can I trust God in the big things if I cannot trust Him with little things such as tomatoes and parking spaces?</p><p><em>Lord, I pray that my faith will continue to grow as I learn to depend on You with the big and little things in my life.

Like many new families, we faced many of life's difficult challenges and decisions. Money wasn't always abundant, living space was limited, and time was lacking. When our son was about 3 years old and our daughter was only 1, we faced more questions: How many children were we intended to have? What did God have in store for our family? Were two children all God had planned for us? We carefully pondered the pros and cons of having more children. We discussed advice given to us by our peers and mentors. We discussed the financial burdens that sometimes come along with an additional family member. We even discussed how it would affect our car and house arrangements.

We want to be happy, and we know that the best way to accomplish this is to abide in Your plan for us.

It was neither what nor how we had imagined it, but it was an answer: I was pregnant with our third child. We were thrilled! God had definitely answered our prayers. Many times we have an idea of how our life should go. We think that we know the right road and the right time to take it.

He picked himself up and felt that tingling in his hands and experienced the blurred vision that reminded him once again of the recent stroke he had suffered. As he leaned heavily on the lamppost, he thought of his plight. It was a beautiful, sunny day, and he had walked a long way from his house--more than a mile. He knew there was a hospital just a few blocks in the opposite direction. He slowly walked to it, thinking they would take care of him. He stopped at the admitting desk, and the nurse asked many questions. The doctor asked even more. Bill tried to tell them he thought he was having a stroke. Either they didn't hear him or didn't believe him. No, they said, they could not (or would not) take care of him. He could go home or to the veteran's hospital.</p><p>Bill turned away, not quite understanding what was going on. He managed the walk as far as the bus stop and took the bus to Harvard Square. Again he almost fell as he was getting off. A young woman student grabbed onto his arm and held him upright, asking what she could do for him. Bill explained his problem. \"I guess I need to go to the veteran's hospital across town.\" The student flagged a taxi and helped Bill into the back seat, making sure he was comfortable. Handing the taxi driver a $20 bill, she said, \"Please take him to the veteran's hospital. If there is any change, give it to him.\" And with a smile and a little wave, she called, \"Goodbye; take care of yourself!\" He blew a kiss to her as a taxi pulled away.</p><p>She was a young student, but quickly became a good Samaritan. She didn't see his ethnicity, only his need. She didn't put him on a donkey, but into a modern taxi, and like the Samaritan of old, provided funds to take care of his problem--enough for the taxi and a little extra. The stories are so similar. May we not fail the test when our turn comes in this our modern age.</p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Dessa Weisz Hardin</div></p>","106"

Distributing vacation periods in a manner that pleased everyone was impossible. </p><p>I was one of those who could take their vacation in the so-called \"good\" period, between January and February. (In Brazil, it is summer in January and February.) In 1994, to benefit a friend, I changed my vacation period from February to May, which is a colder season of the year. When my vacation arrived, my children and husband left for their regular activities, and I had more peaceful time with God. </p><p>Soon after this I did some research and went out in a nearby neighborhood. I found 18 people wanting to study the Bible. So every morning, I left home at 8:00 and returned at noon, ate lunch with my family, and went out again from 2:30 to 6:00 p.m. It was gratifying to see people willing to learn of the love of God!</p><p> I prayed in gratitude: \"Thank You, Lord, for using me. I want to see the fruits of this work.\" When vacation ended, I prayed, \"Lord, give me the opportunity to work for You.\"</p><p>When I returned to work on June 5, my colleagues asked how my vacation had been. I answered that it had been the best vacation time ever because I had studied the Bible with several people and had made new friends. Ending the conversation, I stated, \"I would like Jesus to give me a special leave of absence from work so that I can finish these Bible studies.\" Some colleagues thought I was strange and even laughed at me.</p><p>I have a health problem that in the past has caused me to be away from work as much as eight to 10 days at a time. This problem involved terrible crises. On June 7 the Lord answered my request, made two days earlier. The company doctor called to say, \"As of tomorrow, you will have a 15-day leave of absence, and then go to the National Institute of Social Security Office.\"</p><p>I was able to finish those Bible studies, and eight people accepted Jesus. Praise the Lord!</p><p>I never returned to secular work. I was considered disabled for four years, and today I am retired and work for Jesus.

There's something about sharing a meal with someone that draws us closer together. That's why my most precious mental picture of Jesus is that of having Him come into my home and and eat the meal I cook for Him. I imagine baking for Him my own homemade bread and letting its aroma fill the air. When Jesus knocks at the door, I open it and He says, \"Oh, something smells good!\" </p><p>\"Thank You, Lord!\" I reply. \"I'm so glad You came. I've looked forward to our time together.\"</p><p>I usher Him into the living room and seat Him on my comfortable sofa. (I have carefully fluffed and arranged the throw-pillows ahead of time.) I get out an album of the most recent family pictures for Him to look at while I finish preparing our meal. In the background beautiful music is playing for Him to enjoy. </p><p>\"Lunch is ready. Please, come join me,\" I invite. I lead Jesus into the kitchen to my table that is loaded with good things for us to share. After giving thanks, Jesus Himself breaks the bread, and we eat together. Of course, He loves my cooking. He can taste the love I have stirred into every morsel. But what I love most is His presence in my home--being able to look into His face, to feel His love, to talk to him about everything.</p><p>Of course, it's only a fantasy, but not entirely. I may never get to bake bread for Jesus and have Him come and sit on my sofa. But His presence is with me--in my home and wherever I go. I can feel His love, and I can talk to Him about everything. Someday I will even be able to look into His face.

But sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder: Who is that middle-aged woman staring back at me?</p><p>God has made us wonderfully well, and I'd rather be getting older as opposed to the alternative. But when parts of me don't move as well as they used to, or work as easily as I'd like, I begin to complain.</p><p>My problem is that behind this face I still feel 16. My mind still thinks I'm a teenager. (I think my mom does, too.) Granted, I've packed quite a few years of experiences into this body, and, as a result, I'm probably smarter than I was at 16. I know I make better decisions than I did then.</p><p>My epiphany came today.

It's finished and done with. I can't go back and live over the past--I can only learn from it and go on. Some people I know like to live in \"the good ol' days\" and complain about how terrible everything is today. But God doesn't want us looking back. He wants us to look forward, using the knowledge we've gained from the past. That's why he gave us the past, the present, and a future.</p><p>Today is a new day. There are more possibilities today than during any other day you've ever lived in the past. Today is your opportunity to do something worthwhile--for yourself and for others. If you think you're too old or too young or too tired or too busy, you're absolutely wrong. You are in the best possible place to make a real, positive difference in your life and in the world surrounding you.</p><p>Today is the best opportunity anyone could ever imagine, because what you do with your today is completely up to you.

It isn't a pleasant experience, is it? Do you ever forget it? I never have!</p><p>About 30 years ago my husband and I were spending a quiet evening at home. He was watching sports on television, and I was lying comfortably on our sofa reading <em>The Passions of the Mind</em>, a story about the famous psychiatrist, Sigmund Freud. The title of this paperback book was superimposed onto a cover of bright orange flames. I'm sure it was deliberately designed to be noticed on any store's bookshelf.</p><p>Suddenly there was a knock on our front door. Looking through the foyer, I saw that our unexpected visitor was our pastor. I placed my book on the coffee table in front of me and went to the door to greet him. After his visit, I returned to my comfortable sofa to continue reading. However, my book was missing. Puzzled, I asked my husband if he had seen it. </p><p>\"Oh,\" he replied, \"when I saw who was at the door, I threw your trashy novel in the stairwell. You wouldn't want the pastor to know what you were reading, would you?\" </p><p>It's probably best <em>not</em> to share my reply to my husband! The point is, he saw the title and the bright flames on the cover of a paperback book and decided it was a trashy novel. He didn't ask. He didn't read the synopsis on the back cover. He just made a judgment--and then acted on erroneous information.</p><p>This seems to be the way we humans behave. However, it should <em>not</em> be the way Christians behave. Everyone should receive the benefit of the doubt before we speak or act. In our homes, schools, communities, and churches we often base our opinions of other people on a thread of gossip, a partially overheard conversation, or something we <em>think</em> we saw. Sadly, our hasty judgment divides, wounds, and hurts those whom God is tenderly seeking. </p><p>Today let's determine that we will find out <em>all</em> the facts before jumping to any conclusion. And even if we find we are correct in our judgment, let's <em>still</em> give that person love, kindness, and understanding in the name of Jesus--just as He has so mercifully given to us. </p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Ellie Green</DIV></p>","110"

We laughed and chatted as we enjoyed Indian food. She began to share with me little stories of God's guidance and love from when she was very young in Northern Japan. God helped her to go to Christian school, sending her to Yokahama Seventh-day Adventist Academy and Cheba Seventh-day Adventist College so that she could graduate. From there she got a job for the mission. And that's where our friendship began.</p><p>In 1976 I was a student missionary and she was working at the office in Yokahama. We had a lot of fun hiking, and she also took me out to eat great Japanese food. I even remember playing the piano one Sabbath while she sang in church. I have to say we did a great job with God helping us. I didn't speak any Japanese and she knew very little English, but we managed to get though the song, being inspired by the music and the words. Music was the way we shared God's love that day.</p><p>Time went by--almost 30 years. Then one Sabbath in a church in the United States, I noticed a Japanese woman sitting in front of me. More then once I glanced her, thinking,<em> I know this woman. . . . Is she Kasuko?</em></p><p>Saying a short prayer, I approached her after church. \"Excuse me,\" I began, \"but are you Kasuko?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" she replied. She looked at me a moment, then asked, \"Are you Susen?\" We hugged and rejoiced at finding each other after so long, realizing anew how much God looks out for us. Both of us know God's love through all the ways He leads us in our lives. </p><p>Finding a friend who knows Jesus is very important. I am glad that I have great friends who love Him, and with whom I can share times such as this. </p><p><em>It was wonderful finding friends again after many years.

My bedroom was a little room with a slanting roof and a door leading to the attic. During the day I had no problem with this--I would even go into the attic to play. But in the evening, when it got dark, I was scared of this attic. In my imagination there were all kinds of creeping animals living there--snakes and other crawling things I was so afraid of. I imagined that they would creep under the door from the attic and come and wait for me under my bed. I didn't want to go to this bed. </p><p>\"Please, please carry me to bed,\" I begged my parents. I reasoned that the animals under my bed would not know that I was lying there if they only saw adult feet coming and going. They would think it wasn't a bed, after all, but only a chest of drawers, and that no small child had been laid down there. I would then lie very quietly so that no movement would betray me.</p><p>Often I woke up again in the night, and my fear would overcome me once again. What should I do? The animals were under my bed--I was sure of that. I couldn't sleep because I was so scared. So I put my pillow under my arm and took a big leap, as far as possible from my bed, and raced to my parents' bed as fast as my little legs could carry me.</p><p>Jumping into their bed, I crawled under their blankets and pulled the sheet over my head so that the pursuing snakes would not find me. Now nothing could happen to me. I was safe. Sheltered by the presence of my parents, I instantly fell asleep again. </p><p>You may laugh at my childish fears, but for me they were no trifle. The safety I felt in the presence of my parents reminds me that God is my Father who wants to give us this security in our adult lives, as well.</p><p>The psalmist found this safety in God's presence. Only God was able to protect him. So he was able to write, \"I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.\"</p><p>Do you, too, want to flee to God when life's fears and worries get too heavy to bear?

I've always had a difficult time getting through those parts of the Bible. But that was before I got into genealogy.</p><p>For some time now one of the genealogy commercial web sites has sent me enticing offers to try out their site for free for 14 full days. I managed to ignore their generous offer for about six months, but then I succumbed and began searching to see what I could find. Since most of my family has been gone for many years, I thought, <em>They won't have anything on my family; they weren't famous, or anything. </em>However, much to my amazement, I found family trees for both of my grandmothers. One dates back to Scotland, and the other back to England. At that moment I was hooked. I even began to appreciate all the begats in the Bible for the first time. Just as it was important to the Jewish people to be able to trace their ancestry, I was fascinated with what I was finding about my own family. I am still finding precious gems about where I came from as I search. Since my mother passed away when I was only 4, it is like finding her again.</p><p>We know that pedigrees are important when it comes to purebred dogs, cats, and livestock, and some think it very important to know the backgrounds of people. While I'm enjoying finding my own roots, I believe that the most important kind of roots is to know that I am a daughter of the living God and a sister to His Son, who came and died for me. Ultimately, we are all sons and daughters of Adam and Eve, and heirs of the kingdom.</p><p>My prayer for you today, dear reader, is that you will accept that precious gift that God the Father, and His Son, and the Holy Spirit offers to you: to be His child, and live with Him in His kingdom when He comes to take us home. </p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Loraine F.

I planned a tasty menu and garnished the lemon dessert with mandarin orange wedges and a sliver of maraschino cherries to resemble butterflies. </p><p>Once or twice a year our church social committee plans a surprise guest-and-hostess Sabbath dinner. We have a choice of being guests or hosts. I always sign up as a hostess. I feel that hosts get the biggest surprise--all we know is how many to prepare for. The guests are given an address and, with a bit of ingenuity, they can figure out who their hostess will be.</p><p>The social committee mixes and matches the hosts and guests so that we get to fellowship with folks with whom we may not be well acquainted. It is a week of pleasant anticipation, wondering who's coming to dinner.</p><p>A banquet table is being set in heaven. We're all invited. The choice is ours to accept the free invitation. Unlike our church's \"Company's Coming for Dinner\" event, though, the Host in heaven knows who's coming, but we, the guests, don't know who will be there. When the festive day arrives, I can imagine there will be a lot of talking and laughing around the table as we renew acquaintances and meet new friends.</p><p>For some unknown reason, one couple notified the social committee that they had to cancel as my Sabbath dinner guests. However, they would be able to come for supper that evening or for dinner the next day. However, this was not an open invitation for guests to come at their convenience. Neither is the feast in heaven being served when it fits into our schedule.</p><p>Like the king in the parable of a wedding feast for his son recorded in Matthew 22, I was able to invite another couple who didn't have other plans for the day.</p><p>Let's accept the invitation today--and every day--to meet around God's throne and feast on the tree of life and drink from the river of life.

Not until the day my white count, following a chemotherapy treatment, dropped from 1.9 to .7. (Normal starts around 4.4.) My doctor quickly ordered daily injections that would stimulate the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. The nurse administering the daily injections tried to prepare me. \"When this med takes effect in about four days,\" she said, \"be prepared for some potentially major pain.\"</p><p>Now I've never desired pain.

What helped the most during the next few days of suffering was remembering that this pain was an indicator of something very positive. My immune system was being strengthened precisely because of this painful activity. </p><p>In Hebrews Paul describes the Word of God as being powerful, sharp, and able to penetrate between the joints and marrow. It even discerns my thoughts and hidden motives. Now that can hurt! Yet the resulting spiritual, and even emotional, pain caused by spiritual conviction is a very clear indicator of something most positive occurring.

My husband was excited and wanted me to share in his enthusiasm for the game.</p><p>You will need to understand the difference in our backgrounds. Bill's mother died when he was 3, and his father when he was 5. Since his dad had been an engineer on the railroad, he and his two older brothers were sent to Junior Order Home in Tiffin, Ohio, in 1920. There, he and 1,000 other children were well nourished, clothed, and schooled. They were also thoroughly immersed in sports, including baseball and football. He proudly showed me the stadium where they played when we visited there after we married.</p><p>The only other person we know who was in the Home at the same time Bill lived there, and later joined our church, was Robert Francois. He learned linotype while in the Home and later used that training to work his way through the theology course, becoming a professor of religion. Before his death, he and Bill enjoyed reminiscing about the sports program at Tiffin.</p><p>As for my background, my family was very poor. The eldest of seven children, I learned early in life to enjoy work more than play--and still do! So I can't get enthusiastic about Bill's game, though he has begged me to watch at least the first quarter with him as he patiently explains the different plays and interprets the signals of the referee.</p><p>So I decided that instead of thinking it a waste of time, I could pray for each player. Bill pointed out one of the team members who was religious and could be seen making the sign of the cross while on the field. He assured me that their team would win the game.</p><p>It was estimated that 8 million people around the world, including the soldiers preparing for war with Iraq, watched that game. I'm not sure what the Lord thinks about football, but I do know He loves all those players out there on the field, and I trust Him to answer my prayers on their behalf.</p><p>By the way, the Bucs won, 48-21!</p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Rubye Sue</div></p>","116"

I'm one of those people who have to think things through before coming to a decision; meanwhile, time and opportunities pass by.</p><p>The building of the church where I worship was recently completed, and it was decided to have a grand opening celebration.

It felt as though nothing mattered anymore as I struggled each morning to climb out of bed. Two years before an illness had taken over my life with depression, a vicious cycle of the illness. Brendan and Cameron were the bright spots of this ongoing battle.</p><p>\"Auntie, come on! Paint with me!\" Brendan implored. Obediently, I picked up a brush. \"OK, Auntie, here's what you do\" he commanded. </p><p>I paused. What color should I choose? None looked very cheery to me. Looking over, I observed Brendan painting only with black. \"Bren, I don't see any color. </p><p>Startled he replied, \"Auntie, there's a little blue right there!\"--plopping his finger into a puddle of paint. Looking closely, I saw a blur of blue paint mixed with his black clouds.</p><p>\"You're right! There is some color there!\" I exclaimed, sweeping my paintbrush across the soggy paper. </p><p>\"That's it Auntie! You're painting just like me!\" Brendan encouraged.</p><p>When circumstances fall beyond our control, God is there encouraging us. Can't you hear His cries of exuberance? \"My child, come on, paint with me!\" I couldn't see any color on that gray day, yet Brendan could see what I couldn't.</p><p>Not long after this experience the world opened up with color, if only for a day.

Many times he mentioned that \"So-and-so can go on with that deal now; he's found a silent partner.\"</p><p>I wondered what a silent partner was. One day I asked him.</p><p>\"A silent partner,\" my father explained, \"is when two people start a business project. One person has the know-how, and he's up front doing what needs to be done. The other person doesn't do any of the work or have much to say about how it should be done, but he provides the money to get the project started. He's the silent partner. One can't function without the other.\"</p><p>That simple explanation was enough for me then, and even now I use it to illustrate a point. All my life I have been a doer. If I saw anything that needed to be done, I couldn't rest until it was done by me or someone else. I often acted too soon, spoke too fast, gave help where it wasn't needed, or barged into someone else's domain. My good deeds were often misunderstood, and I spent a great deal of time explaining or apologizing, feeling unhappy and full of remorse when neither of those options was possible.</p><p>Now that I'm older and learning more about living a Christian life, I have a Silent Partner to work along with me. My Silent Partner provides not only money but everything else I need. Unlike other silent partners, He also gives direction and knowledge. He doesn't interfere with what I plan to do unless I ask His advice, then He provides me with printed instructions.</p><p>He has even given me a special \"hotline\" I can use at any time or in any place. I talk over my problems with Him, and He immediately understands. If I wait quietly, I hear His reply in a still small voice that seems to come from inside me. He doesn't speak aloud, but His directions are so clear that He doesn't need to. If I begin to do something wrong He is quick to point out my error. If I persist and end up in disaster, He doesn't gloat or berate. He helps me pick up the pieces and start again.</p><p>My Silent Partner's name is Jesus Christ, and He wants to help you, too.</p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Goldie Down</div></p>","120"

It is the nature of being human that we make mistakes, that we occasionally offend one another, and that we sometimes fail in our efforts to live well. Genetics, temperament, environment, and habit may each play a role in our clumsy behaviors. Nothing, however, exceeds the fact that we are, first of all, human beings. Fundamentally, being human is what we're designed for. It's our generic self, much like the automobile we drive away when we pay only the base price.</p><p>For a human being to live well, however, requires something more. It implies physical, emotional, and spiritual health, none of which carries a particularly high price tag. It has to do with our desire to rise above generic living and above our ability to simply exist. It implies at least a measure of physical fitness. It involves emotionally healthy relationships, intimacy, and genuine forgiveness. It involves connecting with a God who says: \"Here I am. Trust Me. We need each other. I hope you'll accept Me and let Me be a part of your life.\"</p><p>A wise and loving God created within us the gifts to succeed and the ability to fail. As human beings, we do plenty of both. Out of the balance of success and failure, however, we derive character, humility, integrity of mind and spirit, and we experience both joy and grief. Living well is not so much about success or achievement, nor is it about the absence of humiliation or sadness; we need all of those experiences. Living well spiritually, emotionally, and even physically is all about process. Golfers have a saying: \"It's not how you drive, it's how you arrive.\" The process between the tee and the green is what matters. </p><p>Living well is about correcting mistakes while trying to avoid their repetition. Living well is about apologizing to those we offend while trying to avoid repeated offenses. Living well is about making  choices that reduce the magnitude, frequency, and consequences of our failures.</p><p>Living well is to view, to behave, and to respect all others as we would have them view us, behave toward us, and respect us. This is the plain and simple golden rule of a human being's life well lived. It is Christ's life reflected in our lives.</p><p><em>Thank You, Lord, for creating us human, with all the potential of living well.</em><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Leonard L. Bailey</div></p>","121"

No, you're not going crazy. This is normal. A single neuron can receive signals from more than 1,000 other neurons. And these electrical impulses take differing routes and speeds. Some take express routes. Light is bright--you squint your eyes. The dish is hot--you remove your hand quickly. Reflex actions like these travel first to the spinal cord, where the nerve impulse to pull your hand away is initiated; then it travels to the brain. Interestingly, messages sent through pain receptors can travel as slowly as 2 mph, whereas the signal from a kiss travels at an amazing 140 mph! We were created for love!</p><p>To picture the working brain, we might think of viewing New York City from the sky, with cars going in all directions and yet all is orderly and each part is in tune with the others. However, the perfection with which our minds function can become damaged, blunted, or shattered. In addition to injuries or illnesses, the type of stimuli we feed into our systems can distort the perception or interpretation of the information. The communication within can go awry. Neurons (including the chemicals, neurotransmitters and hormones that regulate them, their circuitry, and the electrical impulses that flow through them) make you, <em>you</em> and me, <em>me</em>. We're not all wired the same. Each nerve pathway and connection has been constructed experience by experience, choice by choice.</p><p>We were created for an incredible amount of communication or stimuli reception. Not only are our brains capable of immense amounts of storage, but their programming and reprogramming occur largely as a result of information, chemicals, and stimuli that enter through the avenue of the five senses. What we do with this information or stimuli plays a part in shaping our lives.</p><p>The Lord desires to infuse our senses with information that will cause our hearts to beat with His, our minds to long for His will, and our love to be set upon Him.</p><p><em>Lord, help me to guard my senses so I can have what You created me to experience: Your mind in me--as it was in Your Son, Jesus.</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Ris&#235; Rafferty</div></p>","123"

His frail, weak body was sinking into a coma. Cancer had infiltrated 90 percent of his brain. On August 9, 1982, Shawn's father agreed with the physicians that if he stopped breathing they would not try to revive him.<.p><p>But four days later something remarkable occurred. Red Sox first baseman Dace Stapleton, Shawn's hero, paid him a visit. Upon hearing the voice of the sports champion, Shawn actually awoke from his comatose state and talked for a few minutes about baseball. Then Stapleton leaned over the bed and made a promise. \"Tomorrow,\" he stated, \"I'm going to hit one over the fence just for you.\" Shawn's eyes lit up. During the Red Sox game the following day, when Dace Stapleton first came up to bat he had a determination in his gait. With a steely gleam in his eye he knocked the ball over the left field wall for a home run.</p><p>Five months later, Shawn's doctors were mystified. They could find no trace of the malignancy. The boy seemed almost completely recovered. His family was even planning a trip to Disney World. 
 What made the difference? Some believe it was hope. Shawn's hero made a promise and fulfilled that promise. Possibly, by doing so, he opened a door of hope for Shawn.</p><p>As we begin a new year, it stands before us full of hope. New beginnings and new opportunities. But sometimes optimism fades into disappointment. We discover our lack of ability to make lasting change. We fail to seize the moment. At those times we need to remember that \"the Lord is not slack concerning his promise\" (2 Peter 3:9). And His promise is \"I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee\" (Joshua 1:5). In addition, Psalm 37:4, 5 offers the assurance that God will give us the desires of our hearts.</p><p>In 2 Corinthians 1:20 the apostle Paul says that all God's promises find their \"yes\" in Jesus. He is the key. Jesus imparts power to live a new life and make hope a reality. Rivet your eyes on Him. He will never disappoint.</p><p><em>What changes do you want to make in your life?

To be successful, you must commit to get fit. Humans are creatures of habit. Adopting a new lifestyle requires breaking old, ingrained habits and forging new and perhaps unfamiliar ones. Many meet their Waterloo on this first step because their decision is based on emotional enthusiasm rather than a disciplined commitment. When the going gets tough (it will) and the emotional highs fade (they will), the strength of your commitment must carry you through.</p><p>Decide that you will be a person of your word--with your reputation on the line. Put your resolution in writing and place it where it will continually remind you.</p><p>Ask for divine strength to support you. Remember that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. As you strengthen your physical body He is better able to communicate with you spiritually. The Lord has promised His power to those who ask for it. Develop an awareness that He is beside you when the going gets difficult. Claim God's promise in Jeremiah 30:17: \"I will restore you to health and heal your wounds\" (NIV).</p><p>Ask others to help keep you accountable. Make your decisions public. Public pledges are difficult to break because you don't want to let others down.</p><p>What else do you need in order to keep your commitment? Here's a list of essentials: (1) Have a definite plan, but avoid inflexibility. (2) Make modest beginning goals. Drastic changes may be necessary if serious health hazards need to be dealt with but, generally speaking, excessive goals set you up for failure. (3) Make your plan a part of your daily life. (4) Go for moderation and balance. (5) Expect progress to be gradual. If it took years to get out of shape it will takes months to get it back. (6) Enjoy the process, not just the end product. (7) Don't be too hard on yourself. Old habits die hard. (8) Monitor your progress on a regular basis, but don't be obsessive. (9) Follow the 90/10 rule rather than the 100/0 rule. Go for 90 percent compliance. Cut yourself a little slack, rather than wallow in guilt.

And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. </em>Matthew 8:23, 24, NKJV.</p><p>Does it seem to you that more and more is required of you every day? That the demands of work, family, your children's school--not to mention the burgeoning red-tape that business bureaucracies as well as government are piling up--are just too much?</p><p>Sometimes it reminds me of that story about Jesus asleep in the boat in the midst of a storm. Usually when we preachers tell this story, we go to the part where Jesus commands the winds and the waves to \"be still.\" But it seems to me there is an even larger lesson in the simple fact that He was sound asleep in a sinking boat that was taking on water, with the wind howling and the stinging rain all around Him! \"He slept the sleep of the righteous,\" an older deacon once told me after I preached on this topic. Christ had placed Himself in the hands of His Father and He could sleep completely, deeply, and untroubled no matter the commotion and fear all around him.</p><p>The transforming grace of Jesus is just like that. With all of the muddled demands of supervisors (or your staff), requirements of clients and vendors, corporate switchboards with excessive telephone trees and disembodied voice mail, and unexpected emergencies of your children (or your parents)--with all of that, the transforming grace of the Lord Jesus Christ can help you sleep \"the sleep of the righteous.\" There can be peace on the inside if we allow that transforming grace to permeate our heart and mind completely.</p><p>Frankly, I think Jesus would probably tell us that multitasking is a tool of the devil. The Creator did not make human beings to be pushed to the limit, sucked dry of every bit of energy in order for employers to increase productivity. We have a pandemic of degenerative diseases in America that are the direct result of trying to get too much out of life without putting the same investment back in. Everyone wants to win the lottery; everyone wants to get more than they pay for. Very soon Jesus is coming back to tell us, \"Enough is enough!\"</p><p>We can live in the promise of that coming Kingdom of Peace every day, no matter the storms around us, no matter the excessive demands of bosses, corporations, and institutions. </p><p><em>May the peace and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you today and every day!</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Monte Sahlin</div></p>","126"

Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</em> 1 Corinthians 9:25.</p><p>Those who understand the laws of health and who are governed by principle will shun the extremes, both of indulgence and of restriction. Their diet is chosen, not for the mere gratification of appetite, but for the upbuilding of the body. They seek to preserve every power in the best condition for highest service to God and man. The appetite is under the control of reason and conscience, and they are rewarded with health of body and mind. While they do not urge their views offensively upon others, their example is a testimony in favor of right principles. These persons have a wide influence for good.</p><p>There is real common sense in dietetic reform. The subject should be studied broadly and deeply, and no one should criticize others because their practice is not, in all things, in harmony with his own. It is impossible to make an unvarying rule to regulate everyone's habits, and no one should think himself a criterion for all. Not all can eat the same things. Foods that are palatable and wholesome to one person may be distasteful, and even harmful, to another. Some cannot use milk, while others thrive on it. Some persons cannot digest peas and beans; others find them wholesome. For some the coarser grain preparations are good food, while others cannot use them. . . .</p><p>The diet reform should be progressive. As disease in animals increases, the use of milk and eggs will become more and more unsafe. An effort should be made to supply their place with other things that are healthful and inexpensive. The people everywhere should be taught how to cook without milk and eggs, so far as possible, and yet have their food wholesome and palatable. . . .</p><p>Carefully consider your diet. Study from cause to effect. Cultivate self-control. Keep appetite under the control of reason. Never abuse the stomach by overeating, but do not deprive yourself of the wholesome, palatable food that health demands. . . .</p><p>Eat according to your best judgment; and when you have asked the Lord to bless the food for the strengthening of your body, believe that He hears your prayer, and be at rest.</p><p><em>Wise Creator, give me common sense when it comes to choosing what I should eat.</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Ellen G.

I pumped them three or four times but each time the pedal went straight to the floorboard. My passenger, the conference publishing secretary, let out an involuntary \"Oh, no!\" as he and I careened toward Main Street. </p><p>My aging car, dubbed \"The Green Machine,\" had been in serious need of repair for some time. I relied on several somewhat dubious reasons for delay. As a college student I could hardly afford toothpaste, much less a trip to the garage. Also, my frenetic schedule didn't allow for such sensible pauses. Lastly, I took a perverse, macho delight in seeing how much could go wrong and still have the car get me to where I wanted to go. No wimpy trips to the mechanic for this rugged auto. My only concessions were to carry a few cans of oil and brake fluid in the trunk, plus several jugs of water.</p><p>As Main Street loomed before us, I steered hard right onto a side road that had a gentle incline; that slowed us until I could yank on the emergency brake. I took in a deep breath, filled the master brake cylinder with fluid, and headed off to our next appointment. </p><p>For years I treated myself the very same way. I drove myself until a visit to the repair shop was long overdue. The warning signs were all there--increased anxiety, inability to sleep well, upset stomach, a short emotional fuse, frequent headaches, and overdoses of junk food.</p><p>Then I discovered the simple truth that we need to balance input and output. Our ability to produce depends to a large extent on the time we take to renew. Hours spent replenishing ourselves, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, are just as important, just as valuable, as the time we actually spend working. Not an easy message for a long-time workaholic.</p><p>The Scriptures taught this truth centuries ago with the observation \"To every thing there is a season, and  time to every purpose . . . : a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; . . . a time to keep and a time to cast away\" (Ecclesiastes 3:1-6). We ignore at our peril life's God-given cycles of receiving and giving.

Dr. Victor E. Frankl, who lived through the horrors of the concentration camps in World War II, was asked to make a presentation to his fellow sufferers in the last dreadful days before liberation. He began with the hypothesis that \"our situation was not the most terrible we could think of.\" Here are the points he made to instill hope within the hopeless (from his book <em>Man's Search for Meaning</em>).</p>
<ol><li>Very few of their losses were irreplaceable. Most could be restored or achieved again, such as health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, or position in society.</li>
<li>Although their chance of survival seemed small (perhaps 1 in 20), there was always the possibility that a great opportunity would come their way quite suddenly.</li>
<li>What they had experienced, no power on earth could take from them.</li><li>Human life always has a meaning, and this includes suffering, privation, and death. Regardless of circumstances, life must be lived with dignity and meaning. Even the sacrifice they were forced to make could have meaning if they chose to see that by their suffering someone else might suffer less. Or perhaps by their courage, others would be blessed.</li><li>Life is still expecting something out of them. To give up would mean that someone in the future would suffer because they weren't there; the word of kindness would not be said, a friend would not be helped, the book would not be written. They could never be too sick, too disabled, or too old that God does not need them and what they have to offer.</li></ol><p>Many are angry at God because they think He allowed bad things to happen in order to work out His master plan for the universe, perfect our characters, teach us important lessons, or punish us for our mistakes. But God doesn't make planes crash or boats sink; He doesn't cause children to be born with AIDS, or sentence thousands to die from starvation.

Prayer and medication to follow.\"</li><li>\"For those of you who have children and don't know it, we have a nursery downstairs.\"</li><li>\"The ladies of the church have cast off clothing of every kind, and they may be seen in the church basement Friday.\"</li></ul><p>If you fail to see the humor in these announcements you may have a serious problem (pun intended), because there is hardly a system in your body that a good laugh doesn't stimulate. Laughter benefits the entire cardiovascular system through dilation and increase of blood flow. As you gulp in large amounts of air it creates a rich, highly oxygenated flow of blood. Sometimes this extra flow will make your face flush and you feel refreshed all over. </p><p>While you are laughing your blood pressure and heart rate increase (much like when you exercise), but after the laughter subsides both your blood pressure and heart rate return to levels lower than when you started. According to one expert in the field of humor, your daily laugh total should equal at least 15 chuckles a day or you are under-laughed. </p><p>Have you ever laughed until your sides hurt? Such an experience gives new meaning to the old adage, \"No pain, no gain.\" As your diaphragm convulses it sets up a chain reaction in your body that shakes up your stomach and other vital organs, providing an internal massage.

Here are the facts: kids with dads have healthier social relationships and higher achievement motivation and therefore do better in school. They are more able to defer immediate gratification for later rewards. They have higher self-esteem and are less susceptible to group influence and to juvenile delinquency. In fact, \"All the elements of mental health are better,\" states Dr. Robert Moradi, a psychiatrist at the University of California at Los Angeles's School of Medicine. After analyzing census figures, Dr. Loren Moshen, of the National Institute of Mental Health, concluded that absence of the father was a stronger factor than poverty in contributing to juvenile delinquency.</p><p>But of all the findings  the most incredible was Dr. Kyle Pruett's that men who have been involved in the physical care of children under the age of 3 are significantly less likely to become involved in the sexual abuse of children. Apparently, the very intimacy of feeding, changing diapers, and bathing seems to inoculate men against subsequent sexual arousal, not just in relation to their own children but to others as well. The concluding statement in a special issue of <em>Newsweek</em> Magazine (spring/summer, 1997, p. 73) put it this way: \"Few forces are as powerful, and as underused in our culture, as this sacred bond between father and child, the magnetic attraction of strength for weakness, the 'attachment' that begins with dependence and grows into love.\"</p><p>But there's more: In a study of 1,337 medical doctors who graduated from Johns Hopkins University between 1948 and 1964, lack of closeness with parents was a common factor in hypertension, coronary heart disease, malignant tumors, mental illness, and suicide. In a study of 39 teenage girls suffering from the anorexia nervosa eating disorder, 36 had one common factor: lack of closeness with Dad. In a study done at John Hopkins University, white teenage girls living in fatherless families were 60 percent more likely to have premarital intercourse than those living in two-parent homes.</p><p>Fathers, if you want healthy kids, get involved with them--and with God!</p><p><em>My heavenly Father, may my family see You in me through my actions and my words.</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Kay Kuzma</div></p>","132"

It is a solvent. Nutrients, such as glucose, are dissolved in the blood plasma and transported to body cells, thanks to water. Without water, waste products wouldn't be dissolved and excreted in the urine. Plus, the sense of taste depends on water.</p><p>Water is a lubricant. It prevents friction where surfaces meet and move; it's part of the synovial fluid in the joint cavity that prevents friction as the bone moves. And because the digestive tract mucus (mostly water) is slippery, our food has a smooth passage through the intestinal tract.</p><p>Water changes temperature slowly--it absorbs a great deal of heat before the temperature rises significantly; conversely, it releases a great deal of heat before the temperature drops significantly. This is one of the factors that help our bodies maintain a constant temperature. Plus, without water we wouldn't be able to sweat, which is the evaporation process that helps keep the body cells from overheating.</p><p>These are just a few vital body functions that water makes possible. Yet it's surprising how many people have no idea that their body's health is dependent on getting adequate water.</p><p>In 1991, I was a member of an evangelistic team sent to Lvov, Ukraine, formerly part of the U.S.S.R. I was shocked to learn that as part of the treatment for various diseases, the people had been told to restrict the drinking of water! In one of my first lectures, I talked about the importance of water, stressing that at least eight glasses of water was essential for proper kidney function, which removed wastes from their bodies.

Hosea 10:12, NKJV</em></p><p>Things that need to be done are like monkeys. Feed them and they'll never go home. They cling to you. They chatter incessantly. They vie for your attention. They multiply until they've taken control of your life. They cause stress!</p><p>If your life has become a zoo, follow these monkey-managing rules:<ol><li><em>You're not the only zoo keeper in the world--or in your family. </em>You don't have to do everything. To show your family that you love them, you don't have to cook from scratch or always be the one who does the laundry.<br />If you think you are indispensable to your family, you'll always have too many monkeys. You must believe that your family <em>can</em> get along without your \"working\" for them. Encourage others to do what they are capable of doing, even if it's not done exactly the way you'd do it.</li>
<li><em>Don't feed other people's monkeys. </em>Make sure each person keeps his own monkeys. Don't allow others to dump their monkeys on you. Learn to put responsibility back on others. Learn to feel OK about disappointing others by saying, \"That's not my monkey!\"</li>
<li><em>Keep your monkey population under control.</em> It may sound cruel, but you need to kill the excess ones. Let them starve to death. I've found that things to do tend to expand to fit the amount of time you'll give them. That's why you must prioritize (determine what's really important) and schedule. Allow only a certain amount of time for a project and let the rest \"starve\"; for example, washing windows every time it rains! Learn to just say <em>no.</em></li>
<li><em>Monkeys come in the mail, over the telephone, and via the Internet.</em>Control your mail by reading and processing it immediately. Control the telephone by using an answering machine. Don't be quick to answer yes when someone asks, \"Do you have a minute?\" Set a time when you are available for calls. Budget your time on the Internet.</li>
<li><em>Don't start the weekend with a cage full of monkeys. </em>Instead, plan fun and family into your weekend. Take the Fourth Commandment seriously. Instead of spending your week putting things off until weekend, plan your week so that you'll have time to enjoy the weekend. </li><ol><p><em>How can you reduce the monkeys in your life so you have time for the Lord--and your family?</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Kay Kuzma</div></p>","134"

By this time we can note the genius of the Bible writers to condense more than 2,000 years of history into some 200 pages. We reach Judges 4 and encounter a graphic account of an attack spearheaded by Deborah, prophetess and judge in Israel. Once the enemy troops are routed, the story ends like the 6:00 news: Sisera, the fleeing general, accepted the hospitality of Jael, who gave him milk to drink; then as he slept, she hammered a peg thorough his head. \"His brains oozed out on the ground, his limbs twitched, and he died\" (Judges 4:21, NEB). </p><p>Then we move on to Judges 5. What has happened to the pace of the book? Deborah has composed a song about the battle, and it's inserted into the biblical record--the same story all over again. Why?</p><p>Judges 5 reads like a pitch for a documentary movie. Imagine a director creating the opening scene--people traveling fearfully because of enemy ambush on the road: \"In the days of Jael, caravans plied no longer; men who had followed the high roads went round by devious paths\"(Judges 5:6, NEB). For Israel, the recapitulation came in a song that climaxes with the enemy routed. But at the end we detect a new feature: Deborah is creating a scene she has not witnessed but, with the heart of a mother, can imagine.</p><p>At the home of Sisera, the enemy general, his mother must be waiting for her son's return. Deborah sings: \"The mother of Sisera peered through the lattice, through the window she peered and shrilly cried, 'Why are his chariots so long in coming?'\" (verse 28, NEB).</p><p>The princesses answer: \"They must be finding spoil; . . . booty of dyed stuffs for Sisera, . . .  two lengths of striped stuff--to grace the victor's neck\" (verse 30, NEB).</p><p>This is no amateur production. Deborah knows her characters. We have been transported through her eyes. The retelling is worthy of a pause in the biblical record, as Deborah reminds us of the other side of violence.</p><p><em>As you hear the news today, pause and rerun in your mind the heartache of those who have lost loved ones because of violence--even though they might have been the \"enemy\"!</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Edna Maye Loveless</div></p>","135"

Her folks, brother, and wife had taken the jeep up over the pass, so Nancy and I were driving the two motor homes with all the kids. Everything was fine until we started up Monarch Pass. The altitude affected the carburetors in our motor homes--they kept flooding out. Two miles from the 11,000-foot summit we pulled over again. After I got Nancy's motor home running, I couldn't get mine started. We had a quarter tank of gas but we were parked on a slant and gas couldn't get to the engine. So I got the bright idea that if I could just get some gas in the carburetor  it would start.</p><p>I siphoned some gas into a pressure cooker and placed it between the two front seats. I asked Isadora, my oldest niece, to help me while her sister Alisha watched the dogs in the back. She began to pour gas slowly into the carburetor. The motor started for a moment and quit. Slowly I went from neutral to drive, back and forth, as she poured the gas slowly into the carburetor. Everything was going as planned! We were actually moving when all of a sudden the engine backfired and flames shot up through the carburetor. Isadora dropped the tin cup with gas in it beside the pressure cooker full of gas.</p><p>Instantly I knew we were in trouble. We both jumped up and headed for the door. I grabbed her and threw her out but as I kicked the pressure cooker out, gas went all over me. Just as I was ready to jump out, I noticed the motor home was rolling backwards--and Alisha was still in the back. I climbed back over the fire to the driver's seat, hit the brakes, and jammed the gear into park. But when I got back to the door, the heat of the fire had swollen it shut. I yanked but it wouldn't budge.</p><p>By now I was fully ablaze and as I looked out the little window and saw Nancy and our kids I thought, <em>I'm not going to make it!</em> Just then the door opened on it's own! I jumped out and started rolling to put out the fire. All of a sudden I felt two hands grab my shoulders, stopping me just as a part of my right leg went over a 200-foot cliff. I ran back to check on the motor home. By then the kids had put the fire out and everyone was safe. It was a miracle I was alive. It had to be my guardian angel who opened that door and then grabbed me when I was about to roll off the cliff. </p><p><em>Aren't you glad God sends His angels to protect us, even when we do foolish things that get us into trouble?

Norwegian men who ate the most processed meat had the highest rates of colon cancer. In a 14-year follow-up study of Swedish men, meat (beef and lamb) was the only food linked to higher rates of colon cancer.  A six-year Harvard study of 90,000 women showed that no amount of red meat was safe when it came to colon cancer. Women who ate a main dish of meat daily (beef, pork, or lamb) were 250 percent more apt to develop colon cancer than those eating meat less than once a month. And the more they ate, the greater the risk. Even women who ate red meat infrequently, once a week or once a month, were still 40 percent more apt to get colon cancer than those who ate red meat less than once a month.</p><p>Isn't it time to trade in some of those 21 cows for a truckload of soy-derived protein, swap some of the 14 sheep for a few bushels of beans, totally eliminate the 12 hogs and substitute a couple wheelbarrows of fresh carrots and apples?</p><p>But even more important, I hope you will try the spiritual exchange that Jesus suggested in Matthew 16:24-26.

You bet. Millions of us start the day with dessert, whether it's frosted Pop Tarts, marshmallow laden cereal, chocolate yogurt, or a muffin the size of a small TV. Then we spend the next 14 hours chugging more sweets, from a mid morning Danish to a vanilla shake at lunch to cookies after dinner. Meanwhile, soft drinks rise around us like flood waters: we're swigging nearly 54 gallons a year per person. </p><p>Americans are consuming more than three fourths of a cup of sugar a day for each man, woman, and child. We can't seem to get enough of the white stuff, even as science warns of obesity and other health risks. Are we off to a sweet hereafter?</p><p>People don't realize how much sugar they are consuming because most of it is hidden sugar. For example, soft drinks are the biggest source of refined sugar in the U.S. diet, carrying eight to 12 teaspoons per 12-ounce can. A frozen yogurt contains 12 teaspoonfuls of sugar. </p><p>Sugar is also hidden in most prepared foods such as canned soups and fruits, pot pies, ketchup, TV dinners, and many brands of peanut butter. Most ready to eat cereals contain sugar, and some, such as Fruit Loops and Sugar Smacks, carry 50 percent or more of their calories as sugar.</p><p>Refined, concentrated sugars enter the bloodstream quickly. Up goes the blood sugar, resulting in a quick energy boost  a sugar high. But the high is only temporary because it triggers a surge of insulin. Insulin brings down blood sugar levels and, in the absence of the modulating effects of fiber, sometimes pulls it down too fast and too far.</p><p>A falling blood sugar level often mimics symptoms of hypoglycemia, producing feelings of weakness, hunger, fatigue, and let-down--the sugar blues. The usual reaction is to reach for another sugary snack, and then another, leading to a sort of <em>grazing</em> all day long. Try eating an apple, a banana, or a bowl of brown rice. The fiber in these foods slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. The sugar levels won't jump around so much, your energy will stabilize, and you'll feel satisfied longer.</p><p>The wise man warned us that even a natural food such as honey can be abused.

Up to seven times?\" Jesus said to him, \"I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.\"</em> Matthew 18:21, 22, NKJV.</p><p>There is a reason Jesus told Peter to forgive 490 times. The human brain is a complex organism, with many conscious and unconscious connections. Forgiveness, however, is the catalyst that gets rid of the negative connections. Here's an example:</p><p>Rebecca had been married to a man who had a dark side--he dabbled in pornography and on his trips to other cities he solicited prostitutes. In time, he left Rebecca for another woman. Rebecca felt humiliated and angry. Just the sight of her ex-husband coming to see their children made the adrenalin rush through her system, causing her heart and breathing rates to increase. <em>Anything</em> that reminded her of him, such as his car or even his parents, caused  the same reaction.</p><p>Why was this happening? Neurons that memorized her ex-husband were constantly associating with the noradrenalin neurons, so anything that reminded her of her ex-husband caused her to subconsciously release noradrenalin. As long as there is this association, forgiveness is impossible. That's why Rebecca's first prayers were vengeful: \"God, give my ex-husband what he deserves.\"</p><p>Then she realized this unforgiving spirit was making her feel worse. She could not break the connection between the neurons that memorized her ex-husband and the noradrenaline neurons. As Paul wrote to the Romans, \"Righteousness by works does not work at all!\" (Galatians 2:21). And in Isaiah 64:6 we are reminded that \"all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.\" </p><p>So Rebecca changed her prayer and asked God to give her a forgiving heart. Immediately she experienced a \"heart transplant.\" The connection of her neurons that memorized her ex-husband was switched to the endorphin neurons that gave her peace of mind. Changing her heart changed her head! She did not forget what her husband had done to her, but the bitter feelings were gone. And with that, the process of forgiveness was completed.</p><p>C. S. Lewis put it this way: \"To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable, because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you.\" </p><p><em>If our loving God is willing to forgive our iniquities in order to bring healing, shouldn't we as His children do likewise to the ones who have wronged us?</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Kathleen H.

Then He said to them, \"With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.\"</em> Luke 22:14, 15, NKJV.</p><p>Crack cocaine is made by heating a concoction of cocaine hydrochloride, baking soda, and water. Vaporization leaves behind a small rock. When this rock is smoked by an individual, within eight seconds 80 percent of the cocaine goes to the brain, causing the brain to release dopamine, a pleasure hormone. This results in a massive high that lasts for one or two minutes.</p><p>Upon having that first high, 60 to 80 percent of users are addicted immediately. Within hours they go back for another dose. When they try for a second high, they can't reach the level of the first because their brains have less dopamine to release. So they try more drugs and get less stimulation, finally falling into depression. Because the crack crash is very painful, addicts use other drugs to break the fall, such as marijuana, alcohol, or heroin. Addicts get high from anything that reminds them--money, jewelry--and they must have their high, even if it means killing someone.</p><p>What can be done? Dr. David F. Allen, a psychiatrist who has made the behavior of users of illegal drugs his lifelong study, sees that a spiritual approach holds the most hope for helping addicts. He uses as a model the Lord's last supper with His disciples. </p><p>The first component must be love. Jesus said, \"I love you to the uttermost.\" If we are to help, we must open ourselves to become a vehicle of God's love. Second, Jesus had a time of communion with His disciples. It takes time, but we must meet the addicts' need for food; eat with them, listen.</p><p>Third, we must expect resistance. Judas resisted Jesus' love, but that didn't stop Jesus from His mission. We must not get discouraged. Fourth, Jesus took off His outer garments and did the work of a slave. We must not act \"better than you.\" Fifth, simplicity. Our Lord took a basin of water, something very simple. Programs don't have to be expensive and complicated to be effective.</p><p>Sixth, service. Jesus washed His disciples' feet--even Judas'. Could it be that the real test of the healing power of God is when we can wash the feet of those who would destroy us?</p><p>Seventh, transcendence. This means simply that in spite of terrible problems, God is still on His throne--and if God is for us, who can be against us?</p><p><em>Lord, help me to model my life after Jesus and reach out to help others as He did.

So I decided to do a marathon.</p><p>Preparation began a year before the big day. The first step was to find a book that told me how to safely train for a marathon. The second step was to start the training program, and the third step was to actually implement the training.</p><p>My brother, a veteran marathoner, sent me the book <em>4 Months to a 4-hour Marathon</em>, by Dave Kuehls. I realized that my experience would be more like \"10 Months to a six-hour Marathon,\" but my goal was to finish not to break records.</p><p>I started walking five miles a day, four days a week. Then I increased a mile or two each week. Soon I was up to five to 10 miles a day, for five or six days a week. During this time I added running a mile for every two miles walked. Two months before the marathon I increased my long day to 15 to 18 miles. I was logging in 35 or more miles a week.</p><p>The day of the marathon I felt ready. I felt I had \"fought the good fight\" with a regular training schedule. I would soon find out if I could \"finish the race\"--all 26.2 miles of it!</p><p>At 7:30 a.m. I was off, running/walking in the cold, drizzly Seattle morning. I stopped and refueled at every aid station to keep up my energy. At mile 8, I joined another runner/walker novice marathoner and stayed with her the rest of the race. We encouraged each other and had a great time socializing. At mile 20, my knees started hurting, but I pressed on. After five hours and 45 minutes I limped over the finish line!</p><p>I didn't make headline news or even have a crowd cheering for me, but I have a medal to prove I finished!</p><p>The Christian life is like running a marathon. You need to read the Bible for instruction, make a plan on how to live a Christian life, implement that plan, then finish the race and keep your faith--and your reward will be much greater than a medal!</p><p><em>What would you like to do to live a healthier lifestyle?

Out went the hamburger, ice cream, refined sugar, white flour, margarine, processed foods, candy bars, and caffeinated drinks. She put the family on an exercise program and lectured them about health reform.</p><p>Most health buffs would applaud Cheryl for her zeal, but the way she went about it was anything but healthy. Why? Her family became so angry at her for taking away all the \"good\" stuff and imposing on them a \"restrictive\" lifestyle that they didn't understand, that they turned away in disgust. Just as you can't come home from church a saved person and require all your family to read the Bible and pray, so you can't force health reform on people who haven't yet caught the vision. </p><p>Make health reform attractive. Sweeten it a little. Motivate and make it fun. Persuade; don't push. Here's what I've learned from families who have made the transition successfully:</p>
<ol><li><em>Live what you believe</em>. You can't expect others to live healthily if you don't! Your actions will speak louder than words. Do your children see you putting on your jogging shoes and heading out into the brisk morning air? Do they see you choosing an apple instead of a piece of pie, or water instead of a soda? Pray that God will give you the will power to act on your beliefs.<li>
</li><em>Know why you're doing what you're doing</em>. Living healthily should make sense. Keep it simple. If something depresses your immune system, clouds your thinking, or puts you at risk for heart disease, stroke, or diabetes--it's bad.</li>
<li><em>Be flexible and balanced</em>. Don't be so health-conscious that you make your family miserable. Don't be so concerned about what you put into your mouth that you forget to watch what comes out in terms of criticism and faultfinding. (And if you feel a sermon coming on, bite your tongue!)</li>

But, in fact, the opposite may be true. If we have lots of faith perhaps we will not be healed.\"</p><p> If you question this thesis, as my wife did, here's Bible evidence: All Jesus' disciples but one died a martyr's death, and that one was banished to Patmos. John the Baptist perished alone in the dungeon. Elisha received a double portion of God's Spirit, but died after a lingering illness. Why? It is not God's will that people suffer. But it is His will to have an honor guard of those who continue to trust Him during a devastating illness or terrible trial, and say like Job, \"Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him\" (Job 13:15, NKJV). </p><p>We tend to ignore the stories where God's dedicated people didn't get the miracles they prayed for. Instead we tell the ones about the grasshoppers that stopped at the fence of the tithe payer but ate all the crops of the neighbors. Or if the grasshoppers ate the tithe payer's crops, we tell about him saying, \"If the Lord wants to graze His creatures on His property, that's OK.\"</p><p>Reality is, the vast majority of people who ask for a miracle don't get what they ask for! Instead, these people prove that they do not serve God for what they get out of Him. They serve Him regardless of what happens. This is what real faith is all about.
 One of my favorite writers, \"Anonymous,\" put it this way, \"There is a peace that cometh after sorrow, of hope surrendered, not hope fulfilled, peace that looks not on tomorrow but on the tempest.

Getting a little more difficult?</p><p>These choices illustrate something important to our spiritual health as well as to our physical health. You've probably heard that oat bran and brown rice are the better choices because of their high fiber content. Fiber is there not just to make the food brown. It plays a vital role in the intestines of our digestive system. It's like the brooms in our houses. It goes in and sweeps out the innermost parts and removes the remains of the food that our bodies could not use. It also purifies our systems of harmful carcinogens (agents that cause cancer) and other microorganisms that, if left,  would make us sick from such diseases as colon cancer, diverticulitis, and ulcerative colitis.</p><p>The Word of God is also vital, and plays a role similar to fiber. Reading it must be our number one choice. It is not there to look pretty on our shelves or to carry to church in attractive binders, but to be eaten, to be digested, and to become a part of us.</p><p>Jesus, when praying to His Father for His disciples and us, prayed that we would be sanctified by His truth. He said that His Word, the Word of God or the Bible, is truth.</p><p>The Greek word for sanctify is <em>haziago</em> (haz ee ahd go), which means to purify. The Word of God is our spiritual broom. As we read it, it goes to the innermost parts of our beings, our hearts, and shows us our need of Christ. </p><p>Through the Holy Spirit, the Word sweeps our soul temples clean of habits, desires, appetites, and character traits that if allowed to remain would leave us sick with the disease of sin. We must be purged of these things to make it through the final moments of earth's history. Our Saviour will return soon.

Don't let the sun go down with you still angry--get over it quickly; for when you are angry you give a mighty foothold to the devil.</em> Ephesians 4:26, 27, TLB.</p><p>On rare occasions as a child I heard my folks speak angry words--usually when Dad was driving one way, and Mom thought we should be going another! It wasn't hostile; they weren't trying to hurt each other. They were just trying to get their points across. But the loud voices and negative words made an impact on me. After the passion blew over, which usually happened quickly, I felt the hurt in my sensitive heart. And I figured there had to be a better way to settle differences.</p><p>Psychologists have observed the destructive effects of long-term anger and have erroneously come to the conclusion that you've got to get it out, regardless of whom you hurt. But it's never appropriate to hurt another in order to heal yourself! Instead, the Bible admonishes us to be kind, tenderhearted, and forgiving (Ephesians 4:32)!</p><p>Now studies are proving the psychologists were wrong--and the Bible right.  The answer is in prevention, early recognition, and educated control. It's not wrong to feel angry as a temporary emotion that produces needed energy to correct injustice, but how you express that emotion--the behavior that follows--is what matters. If it hurts yourself or others, it's wrong! </p><p>If you stuff it, you're going to mess up the way God intended your body to work. Anger produces an adrenaline rush that God designed for your survival--to fight or flee. Stuffed anger keeps the adrenaline motor running--flooding body tissue and organs with unnecessary chemicals that damage the arteries, elevate blood pressure, and cause headaches, ulcers, and premature heart disease.</p><p>But the same thing happens if you express anger with angry words and behavior! Dr. Carol Tavris reviewed anger research, then wrote the book <em>Anger, The Misunderstood Emotion</em>. Her conclusion was that freely venting doesn't relieve anger but increases it and establishes a hostile habit. She says it is better to \"keep quiet about your momentary irritations and distract yourself with pleasant activity until your fury simmers down.\" </p><p>This method is good for your health because it avoids the unnecessary adrenaline rush that poisons your system.

I did drugs, smoked, drank alcohol, was fat, skipped high school classes, had a horrible attitude, and was mean to my family. When I was a junior I dropped out and wasted a year of my life watching TV and partying.</p><p>I believed in the power of self. If I wanted something, I got it.

 That's where I met Kari, who had taken her physical therapy training at Andrews University, a Seventh-day Adventist school just a few miles from our home in South Bend. When I was running 10 to 12 miles a day training for a marathon, Kari would bike or run beside me and tell me Bible stories--something I'd never heard before. As our friendship grew, she encouraged me to apply to the physical therapy program at Andrews University. No way! My grades were lousy!

One little fellow said, \"But down here we have 'God First.'\" How true it is that the greater includes the lesser. The one who puts God first in his life is assured of safety. The Most High becomes his habitation, and no evil will befall him (Psalm 91:9, 10). Whatever comes, God will care for him and he will have a place of refuge.</p><p>Every soul needs a refuge. Sooner or later we all must find a place of safety, an impregnable fortress. Sometimes the world is too much for us and we must flee to that \"place of quiet rest, near to the heart of God.\" Our Lord Jesus Christ said to His weary disciples, \"Come ye . . . apart . . . and rest a while\" (Mark 6:31).</p><p>Our great enemy, the devil, is a merciless oppressor. His service is cruel bondage. But the Lord offers freedom to the oppressed. He has proclaimed \"liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof\" (Leviticus 25:10). He offers pardon, hope, and peace to sinners. \"God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself\" (2 Corinthians 5:19). But let us remember that our text promises a refuge to earnest Christians. In every time of trouble the Lord is their refuge. \"God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble\" (Psalm 46:1). And He pleads, \"Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope\" (Zechariah 9:12).</p><blockquote>\"The Lord's our Rock, in Him we hide,<br />A shelter in the time of storm;<br />Secure whatever may betide,<br />A shelter in the time of storm.\"</blockquote><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust\" (Psalm 18:2).</p>","201"
"2","2","What do You Really Believe?","The Promises of God","<p><em>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins</em> (Matthew 1:21).</p>

<p>As he was nearing death, Thomas D. Talmage, the great evangelist, was asked by his son, \"What do you really believe now, Father?\"</p>

<p>Quickly the answer came: \"Well, Son, when I started to preach at twenty-five years of age, I held to one hundred doctrines; at thirty-five, I had fifty; at fifty, only twenty-five; later on, there were but ten; and now as I am facing eternity, I hold only this one: I am a great sinner, but Jesus Christ is a great Saviour.\"</p>

<p>The word \"Jesus\" means \"Saviour.\" It is our Lord's personal name and was given to Him at birth by angelic command. The word \"Christ\" means \"the Anointed,\" or \"Messiah\" (John 1:41). It was at His baptism in the Jordan River that Jesus was anointed by the Holy Ghost (Acts 10:38) and publicly proclaimed by the voice of God to be His Son (Matthew 3:16, 17). By His resurrection and ascension He was finally proved to be Christ in the full sense of the word. \"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ\" (Acts 2:36). His name reveals three things about His salvation:</p>

<p>First, He and He alone can save. \"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved\" (Acts 4:12).</p>

<p>Second, He will save only \"his people,\" the saved of all nations. (Compare 1 Peter 2:9; Titus 2:14; Acts 15:14.)</p>

<p>Third, His name shows the breadth and depth of His salvation. He saves not only from the consequences of sin but from the sin itself, showing that He is the source not only of justification but also of sanctification. His name is really the contents table of the whole Bible. Are we among His people? Is He our Saviour now?</p>

<p>When Lord Nelson sent home to England his dispatches following the Battle of the Nile, he wrote, \"<em>Victory</em> is not a name strong enough for such a scene as this.\" What will it be when the promise of our text is completely fulfilled? The word \"victory\" will not be strong enough for such a scene, such glory. This promise follows well on our text for September 1. Believers have the promise not only that the Seed of the woman will bruise the serpent's head but that he will be bruised under <em>their</em> feet. Victory will not come to God's children by their own power. It is God who will bruise Satan.</p>
<p>In His conflicts with Satan our Saviour left us an example. He used \"the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God\" (Ephesians 6:17). In His three great temptations our Lord relied on the sword of the Scripture, and the enemy was not able to match its power. The Saviour had only the Old Testament, but today we have the New Testament also to draw upon. Let us use this heavenly weapon, which is \"sharper than any two-edged sword\" (Hebrews 4:12). So let us \"keep looking up, going forward in faith,\" for the promise is that \"God . . . shall bruise Satan under your feet <em>shortly</em>.\" Until then, we may have victory every day. Let us often think of that word \"shortly.\" What a joy to hear it! Soon, quickly, shortly, the victory will be ours and Satan's head be bruised. For this we must trust the God of peace. \"And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith\" (1 John 5:4).</p>
<blockquote>Have faith in God, His victory brings release;<br />Have faith in God, each day thy joy increase;<br />Have faith in God, soon comes His rest and peace;<br />Have faith, dear friend, in God.</blockquote><p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER:</strong> \"But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head\" (Psalm 3:3).</p>

<p>The waters of Noah will not return. The rainbow is a teacher from generation to generation. Children ask its meaning, and reverent parents explain it to them: There will not be another universal flood.</p>
<p>God's covenant with Noah still stands fast. Someday it will be completed in the eternal redemption of His people. So why should we worry about the clouds of trouble that darken the world? We never see the rainbow until a cloud arises. It has been said, \"The soul would have no rainbow had the eyes no tears.\" How often we fail to think of God's promises until we find ourselves in one of life's cloudy days. Then we search the memory and God's Holy Book for them. When the sky is dark, God's precious promises shine like a rainbow above our troubles.</p>
<p>There is a rainbow about His throne (Revelation 4:2, 3). He always sees it there and remembers His promise. Our Saviour, who pleads His blood for our sins, points to the bow as a token of God's peace with the human race. It was the prophet Ezekiel who saw that \"as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about\" (Ezekiel 1:28). The more we know of God, the more we shall trust His rainbow promise of peace and love.</p>

<p><em><em>A tree keeps on growing as long as it lives; so should the true believer. Like a tree, he grows stronger day by day and year by year. The age of a tree can usually be determined by its annual growth rings. In dry years they are narrow; in seasons of plentiful rain they are wide. But the tree always grows <em>some</em>. Sometimes the growth is rapid, sometimes slow, but it is growth. The law of a tree is \"grow or die.\" So it is with the man who delights in the law of the Lord. He grows spiritually--in easy times and hard, in prosperity and adversity--sometimes rapidly, at other times slowly; but he grows.</em></em></p>

<p><em><em>One never forgets his first view of the great sequoia trees of California. He bares his head in reverence before the General Sherman Tree, probably the oldest living thing on earth today. We are told that it was a large tree when David wrote the first psalm, which contains our text for today. It was a great tree when Jesus walked by Galilee, a monarch in the days of the Reformation, and now it is a world wonder. Empires have risen and fallen, but that great tree lives and is still growing. The child of God is to be like a tree, a tree planted by the rivers of water, always growing.</em></em></p>

<p><em><em>Looking down from a high mountain, I once gazed across the Arizona desert. Across its sun-scorched face ran a green line to the far horizon. It was the strange, upside-down Hassayampa River. The waters flowing sometimes unseen beneath its sandy bed nourish the luxuriant trees that mark its course across the desert. \"Like a tree planted by the rivers of water,\" the child of God lives, grows, and bears fruit in the desert of this world. This is God's promise: \"He shall be like a tree.\"</em></em></p>

(John 3:14, 15)</em></p><p>Because of their sins the children of Israel were attacked by \"fiery serpents\" in their wilderness journey (Numbers 21). Thousands died. By divine instruction Moses made a serpent of brass and erected it upon a pole. Then all who looked upon it were healed. This was an enacted prophecy of Christ and His death for our sins.</p>
<p>An ill man came to his druggist and said, \"Can you give me something for a bad cold?\"<br />\"Have you brought your prescription with you?\" asked the druggist.<br />\"No,\" was the answer, \"but I brought my cold with me to be cured.\"</p>
<p>Often those seeking a cure for the sin disease try to bring their prescription to the Lord, but all He asks is that the sinner say:</p><blockquote>Just as I am, without one plea<br />But that Thy blood was shed for me.</blockquote>
<p>Notice, the Son of man must be lifted up, must die, if we are to live. At the cross His bitter enemies said, \"He saved others; himself he cannot save\" (Matt. 27:42). They never told a greater truth. To save men, He had to die. That's why He came to this world--\"to give his life a ransom for many\" (Matthew 20:28). And notice this: God used death, the terrible wages of sin, to destroy sin and death and to bring eternal life to all believers. A look at the brazen serpent healed the serpent's bite. At last it will be seen that our Saviour's death upon the cross was really the death of death.</p>
<p>Read today's promise text again and emphasize the word \"whosoever.\" That includes all of us if we will believe.</p>

<p>On his deathbed, King Philip II of Spain sent this word to his confessor: \"Father Confessor, ...I protest to you that I will do everything you shall say to be necessary for my being saved, so that what I admit doing will be placed to your account, as I am ready to acquit myself of all that shall be ordered to me.\" And one writer says, \"He did everything he could for salvation.\"</p>
<p>Our promise text for today shows God's answer, the only answer, to earth's great problem--how to be righteous, how to be good. This is never accomplished by human effort. It is the gift of God, and faith is the hand by which we accept it. \"The just shall live by faith\" (Galatians 3:11). Sinners are made righteous by faith, not by works.</p>
<p>Notice here the law of first mention. In our text three great salvation words--\"believed,\" \"counted,\" \"righteousness\"--are found for the first time in the Bible, and all together. Abraham believed in the Lord, and God did the rest. Surely we can believe God when in His Word He promises to forgive our sins and count us righteous through Christ's atoning sacrifice. \"Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus\" (Romans 3:22-24).

<p>\"Tell me,\" said one of Luther's enemies, \"when the whole world turns against you--church, state, princes, people--where will you be then?\"</p>
<p>\"Why, then as now,\" cried Luther, \"in the hands of Almighty God.\"</p>
<p>God was sending Moses to confront the most powerful ruler in the world. No wonder he was afraid. But would God send a man alone to reprove a king and defeat an empire? Of course not! \"Certainly I will be with thee.\" What more than that promise did Moses need?</p>
<p>As John Wesley lay dying, his preachers gathered round his bed. Suddenly he roused from unconsciousness, a smile broke over his face, and he said, \"The best of all is, God is with us.\" To us today, as to Moses and Wesley, that is the best of all. When God sent heaven's richest treasure, His Son and our Saviour, to redeem mankind, the inspired promise declared, \"They shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us\" (Matthew 1:23). When we go on God's errands He is with us, so we cannot fail. Then let us go, not timidly, halfheartedly, carelessly, or presumptuously, but realizing the very presence of God.</p>

"2","29","We are Not Our Own","The Promises of God","<p><em>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are </em>(1 Corinthians 3:17).</p>

<p>It is the will of God that every man, woman, and child should be His living temple. In view of this, our text for today is a double promise--a warning and an encouragement. First, the warning: Destruction is ahead for him who desecrates God's temple. In all lands, temples are places to be entered with reverence. In Western lands one uncovers his head in sacred places; in Eastern lands he removes his shoes. Any act of sacrilege would be punished by the authorities, or more directly by the worshipers present.</p>

<p>But notice our text--God Himself will punish those who defile His temple. This is as certain as it is serious. God will destroy them. Why? Because \"the temple of God is holy.\" When holiness is ignored, there is danger ahead. Nadab and Abihu \"offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them\" (Leviticus 10:1, 2). Uzzah profaned the holy ark and died \"by the ark\" (2 Samuel 6:7). Uzziah defiled the Temple, and leprosy rose up in the forehead of the angry king, \"beside the incense altar\" (2 Chronicles 26:19).</p>

<p>Now the encouragement: \"The temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.\" We are not our own. \"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's\" (1 Corinthians 6:20).</p>

<p>Yes, we are to glorify God in our bodies--in our eating, drinking, exercising, breathing, doing. We are to glorify God in our spirits--in our thinking, planning, meditating, praying. \"Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God\" (Romans 12:2).</p>

<p><strong>MEDITATION PRAYER: </strong>\"O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens\" (Psalm 8:1).</p>

"2","1","Never Cast Off","The Promises of God","<p><em>For the Lord will not cast off for ever: but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies</em> (Lamentations 3:31, 32).</p>

<p>Kagawa of Japan, once threatened with blindness, lay for months in the dark with scorching pain in his eyes. He wrote: \"Health is gone. Sight is gone. But as I lie forsaken in this dark room, God still gives light. At the center of things there is a heart.\"</p>

<p>Do you think the Lord has cast you off, that He has actually forgotten you? If so, read this promise again, \"The Lord will not cast off for ever.\" He may cast away for a time, when He sees reason for it, but not forever. When it seems that your prayers are not answered, do not despair or cease to pray or to have faith in God. Job went through such an experience. His battle with Satan was more desperate than most of us ever wage, yet he was in God's keeping all the time. In his darkest hour of loss and grief he said of God, \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him\" (Job 13:15).</p>

<p>In the Scripture, God is sometimes said to cause what He permits. \"Though he cause grief,\" we read, \"yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.\" Sometimes God causes grief because He has compassion. Some lessons can be learned only in the school of tears. Then we turn to God in earnest. His Word becomes real to us, and its promises most precious. Then we see God's sunshine through the rain. Even of Christ in His humanity it is written, \"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered\" (Hebrews 5:8).</p>

<p>Do you think you are cut off? No, never! \"God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew\" (Romans 11:2). He loves you. Of Jesus and His disciples it is written, \"Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end\" (John 13:1). He still loves you, so be of good cheer!</p>

You saw me before I was born. </em>Psalms 139:15, 16, NLT.</p><p>God's process by which a  human being is created is probably the greatest wonder of the universe. It starts with a few million sperm swimming, pollywog-like, towards a released ovum in the fallopian tubes. One lone swimmer arrives shortly before the rest. It penetrates the mucosa layer covering the cell and delivers its half of the DNA required to give the ovum the potential to create a child. As a result of this penetration, in an instant a cascade of chemical changes occurs that block the entry of other sperm cells, insuring the proper development of the embryo.</p><p>Within hours the fertilized ovum is implanted in the uterine wall and begins to replicate, forming stem cells. All are clones of each other--exact copies of the original ovum. Yet within a few more hours each of them will \"decide\" to make something different from the others.</p><p>Ponder for a moment that one of these stem cells \"decides\" to be a certain organ--perhaps it will make the heart. For a few hours it appears  to be dividing simply at random but as one watches, as it were, under the microscope, the early shape of a heart materializes before your eyes. The cells continue to divide, making muscle, vessels--arteries and veins--valves, tendons connected to the valves and muscles, neural network structure--all in the most perfect and marvelous order. In about two weeks there is a kind of twitching of muscle tissue that in about three more weeks will be detectable by the gynecologist as the infant's heartbeat. It's not pumping blood yet, but it's beating.</p><p>Another stem cell \"decides\" it will become an eye. It forms the only completely transparent tissue in the body--cornea and lens. It makes an iris to respond to changes in light intensity or brightness by automatically operating miniature muscles. It creates the beautiful eye color, muscles, tendons, rods, cones, vessels--all in the right places and in the right sizes. Perhaps most remarkable of all is the nerve bundle that grows from the back of the eye and penetrates the growing brain near the rear of the head. It turns, dives, and twists back, and then connects to a few billion precisely chosen brain nerve cells so there will be vision!</p><p>And this same precise, intricately engineered process happens as each of the different organs is formed. Incredible, isn't it?</p><p><em>Once more, Lord, I have to exclaim, as did the psalmist, \"I am indeed wonderfully made!\"</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Jim Brackett</div></p>","334"
"5","11","The Significance of a Marshmallow","Fit Forever: One-A-Day Devotionals for Body, Mind, and Spirit","<p><em>So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. </em>Galatians 5:16, NIV.</p><p>Imagine you are 4 years old. Picture yourself in a strange room; a strange person gives you a marshmallow and promises you a second one if you don't eat the first one until he returns from a short errand. What do you do? Do you gobble down the marshmallow, not thinking about the possibility of another? Or, with nothing to do but stare at the marshmallow, do you muster all the self control available to you as a 4-year-old and wait until the giver returns?</p><p>That question has proved to be a classic in a research study conducted on a group of 4-year-olds. When the researchers tracked down the children 14 years later they found that this test was an amazing predictor of how the children would do in school. The ones who had waited in the test scored significantly higher--210 points higher--on their Scholastic Achievement Test. In addition, the kids who had patiently waited were, later, more stable emotionally than the other group, better liked by their teachers and their peers, and were still able to delay gratification in pursuit of their goals.</p><p>The children who had eaten the marshmallow immediately were, 14 years later, less emotionally stable, more irritable, more likely to pick fights, not as well liked, and fell apart under stress.</p><p>The Bible talks about the importance of self-control. Galatians 5:22, 23 says, \"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, <em>self control</em>. Against such things there is no law\" (NIV). While our society places great emphasis on scholastic success--defined as how much knowledge you can pack into your brain in a given amount of time--God, as usual, has an entirely different way of measuring success.</p><p>Now science has caught up with what the Bible has always presented to us. God promises us success, not based on worldly standards, academic achievement, or measures of wealth, but  upon His Spirit working in us. When He develops the fruits of the Spirit in our characters we will be healthier and happier, our relationships will be more satisfying, our academic pursuits more successful, and our jobs more fulfilling. Better yet, we will be successful not only in the physical world but in the spiritual world as well. That's were it really counts.</p><p><em>Isn't it interesting that one character trait--self-control--can have such a widespread effect on a person's success in life? How healthy is your self-control?</em></p><p><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>--Carole Brousson Anderson</div></p>","343"
