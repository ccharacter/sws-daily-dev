that I am a great sinner, but that Jesus
Christ is a great Savior.</i>\" -H.M.S. Richards

People who knew H.M.S. Richards considered him one of the choicest jewels God ever gave us! Visionary. Pioneer. Preacher of righteousness. Man of God.

A tireless reader and scholar, Richards devoured books. He was especially diligent as a student of the Bible, and was rarely found without one in his pocket. He constantly searched for information in many fields of knowledge, discovering facts and quotes that kept his messages always fresh and vibrant.

He was a pioneer in using radio to deliver the gospel, and he dreamed of the day when Christians would use satellites to beam the Good News on the air, every day, everywhere.

H.M.S. Richards believed in incredible answers to prayer. Miracles sustained him every day of his life. He believed God supplies amazing answers, provided we take hold of the PROMISES OF GOD and tap into the electricity of prayer.
